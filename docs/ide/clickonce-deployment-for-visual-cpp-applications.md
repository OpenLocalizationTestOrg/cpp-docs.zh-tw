# ClickOnce Deployment for Visual C++ Applications
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../assembler/masm/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] provides two different technologies for deploying Windows applications: ClickOnce deployment or [Windows Installer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc185688) deployment.  
  
## ClickOnce Deployment in C++  
 The [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../build/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] development environment does not directly support deployment of [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../build/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] projects with [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)], but tools are available to use it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../assembler/masm/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] does support [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] in the [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../ide/includes/csprcs_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../dotnet/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] development environments. If your [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../build/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] project is a dependency of a [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../ide/includes/csprcs_md.md)] project, you can publish the application (including its dependencies) using [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] deployment from the [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../ide/includes/csprcs_md.md)] development environment.  
  
 To deploy a [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../build/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] application using [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)], you first have to build a [ClickOnce Application Manifest](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-application-manifest) and a [ClickOnce Deployment Manifest](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-deployment-manifest) using the [Mage.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/77dfe576-2962-407e-af13-82255df725a1) or its graphical user interface version (for information, see [MageUI.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool, Graphical Client)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/f9e130a6-8117-49c4-839c-c988f641dc14)).  
  
 You first use Mage.exe to build the application manifest; the resulting file will have the extension .manifest. You then use Mage.exe to build the deployment manifest; the resulting file will have the extension .application. You then sign the manifests.  
  
 The application manifest must specify the target processor (**x86**, **x64**, or **ARM**). See [Deploying Prerequisites for 64-bit Applications](/visualstudio/deployment/deploying-prerequisites-for-64-bit-applications) for information on these options.  
  
 Also, the name of the application and deployment manifests must be different from the name of the C++ application. This avoids conflict between the application manifest created by Mage.exe and the external manifest that is part of the C++ application.  
  
 Your deployment will need to install any [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../build/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] libraries on which your application depends. To determine the dependencies for a particular application, you can use depends.exe or the DUMPBIN utility with the /DEPENDENTS option. For more information on dependencies, see [Understanding the Dependencies of a Visual C++ Application](../ide/understanding-the-dependencies-of-a-visual-cpp-application.md). You might need to run VCRedist.exe; this utility installs [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../build/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] libraries on the target computer.  
  
 You may also need to build a bootstrapper (prerequisites installer) for your application to deploy prerequisite components; for information on the bootstrapper, see [Creating Bootstrapper Packages](/visualstudio/deployment/creating-bootstrapper-packages).  
  
 For a more detailed description of the technology, see [ClickOnce Security and Deployment](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment). For a detailed example of [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] deployment, see [Walkthrough: Manually Deploying a ClickOnce Application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/ccee6551-a1b9-4ca2-8845-9c1cf4ac2560).
