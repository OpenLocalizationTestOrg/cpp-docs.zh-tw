# Redistributing Visual C++ Files
When you deploy an application, you must also deploy the files that are required to support it. If any of these files are provided by Microsoft, check whether you are permitted to redistribute them. To review the Microsoft Software License Terms, see License.htm in the directory where Visual Studio is installed, or on the Visual Studio installation media. To view the "REDIST list" that is referenced in the "Distributable Code" section of the Microsoft Software License Terms for certain editions of Visual Studio, see [Distributable Code for Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=523763) on the Microsoft website. For more information about redistributable files, see [Determining Which DLLs to Redistribute](../ide/determining-which-dlls-to-redistribute.md) and [Deployment Examples](../ide/deployment-examples.md).  
  
 To deploy redistributable Visual C++ files, you can use the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages (VCRedist_x86.exe, VCRedist_x64.exe, or VCRedist_arm.exe) that are included in Visual Studio. These files can be found under your Visual Studio installation directory in Program Files [(x86)]\Microsoft Visual Studio *version*\VC\redist\\*locale*\\. Another option is to use redistributable merge modules (.msm files), which can be found in Program Files [(x86)]\Common Files\Merge Modules\\. It's also possible to directly install redistributable Visual C++ DLLs in the *application local folder*, which is the folder that contains your executable application file. For servicing reasons, we do not recommend that you use this installation location.  
  
 The Visual C++ Redistributable Packages install and register all Visual C++ libraries. If you use one, you must set it to run on the target system as a prerequisite to the installation of your application. We recommend that you use these packages for your deployments because they enable automatic updating of the Visual C++ libraries. For an example about how to use these packages, see [Walkthrough: Deploying a Visual C++ Application By Using the Visual C++ Redistributable Package](../ide/deploying-visual-cpp-application-by-using-the-vcpp-redistributable-package.md).  
  
 Each Visual C++ Redistributable Package checks for the existence of a more recent version on the machine. If a more recent version is found, the package is not installed. Starting in Visual Studio 2015, redistributable packages display an error message stating that setup failed. If a package is run by using the **/quiet** flag, no error message is displayed. In either case, an error is logged by the Microsoft installer, and an error result is returned to the caller. Starting in Visual Studio 2015 packages, you can check a registry value to find out if a more recent version is installed. The currently installed version is stored as a REG_SZ value in the Version key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE[\Wow6432Node]\Microsoft\DevDiv\vc\Servicing\14.0\RuntimeMinimum. You don't need to install your redistributable package if the currently installed version is more recent.  
  
 If you use a merge module that contains a Visual C++ DLL, you must include it in the Windows Installer package (or similar installation package) that you are using to deploy the application. For more information, see [Redistributing By Using Merge Modules](../ide/redistributing-components-by-using-merge-modules.md). For an example, see [Walkthrough: Deploying a Visual C++ Application By Using a Setup Project](../ide/walkthrough-deploying-a-visual-cpp-application-by-using-a-setup-project.md), which also shows how to use InstallShield Limited Edition to create an installation package.  
  
## Potential Run-Time Errors  
 If a Visual C++ library DLL is not reachable and Windows cannot load it for your application, this message may be displayed: **This application has failed to start because MSVCR\<version number>.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.**  
  
 To resolve this kind of error, make sure that your application builds correctly and that Visual C++ libraries are correctly deployed on the target system. For more information, see [Understanding the Dependencies of a Visual C++ Application](../ide/understanding-the-dependencies-of-a-visual-cpp-application.md).
