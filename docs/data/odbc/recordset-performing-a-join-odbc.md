# Recordset: Performing a Join (ODBC)
This topic applies to the MFC ODBC classes.  
  
## What a Join Is  
 The join operation, a common data-access task, lets you work with data from more than one table using a single recordset object. Joining two or more tables yields a recordset that can contain columns from each table, but appears as a single table to your application. Sometimes the join uses all columns from all tables, but sometimes the SQL **SELECT** clause in a join uses only some of the columns from each table. The database classes support read-only joins but not updateable joins.  
  
 To select records containing columns from joined tables, you need the following items:  
  
-   A table list containing the names of all tables being joined.  
  
-   A column list containing the names of all participating columns. Columns with the same name but from different tables are qualified by the table name.  
  
-   A filter (SQL **WHERE** clause) that specifies the columns on which the tables are joined. This filter takes the form "Table1.KeyCol = Table2.KeyCol" and actually accomplishes the join.  
  
 You can join more than two tables in the same way by equating multiple pairs of columns, each pair joined by the SQL keyword **AND**.
