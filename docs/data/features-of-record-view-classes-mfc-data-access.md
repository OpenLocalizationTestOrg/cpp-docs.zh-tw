# Features of Record View Classes  (MFC Data Access)
You can do form-based data-access programming with class [CFormView](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md), but [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and [CDaoRecordView](../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) are generally better classes to derive from. In addition to their `CFormView` features, `CRecordView` and `CDaoRecordView`:  
  
-   Provide dialog data exchange (DDX) between the form controls and the associated recordset object.  
  
-   Handle Move First, Move Next, Move Previous, and Move Last commands for navigating through the records in the associated recordset object.  
  
-   Update changes to the current record when the user moves to another record.  
  
 For more information about navigation, see [Record Views: Supporting Navigation in a Record View](../data/supporting-navigation-in-a-record-view-mfc-data-access.md).
