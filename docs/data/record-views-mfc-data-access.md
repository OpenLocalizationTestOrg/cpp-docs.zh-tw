# Record Views  (MFC Data Access)
This section applies only to the MFC ODBC and DAO classes. For information about OLE DB record views, see [COleDBRecordView](../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md) and [Using OLE DB Record Views](../data/oledb/using-ole-db-record-views.md).  
  
 To support form-based data-access applications, the class library provides class [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and class [CDaoRecordView](../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md). A record view is a form view object whose controls are mapped directly to the field data members of a [recordset](../data/odbc/recordset-odbc.md) object (and indirectly to the corresponding columns in a query result or table on the data source). Like their base class [CFormView](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md), `CRecordView` and `CDaoRecordView` are based on a dialog template resource.  
  
## Form Uses  
 Forms are useful for a variety of data-access tasks:  
  
-   Entering data  
  
-   Performing read-only examination of data  
  
-   Updating data  
  
## Further Reading About Record Views  
 The material in topics applies to both the ODBC-based and the DAO-based classes. Use `CRecordView` for ODBC and `CDaoRecordView` for DAO.  
  
 Topics include:  
  
-   [Features of Record View Classes](../data/features-of-record-view-classes-mfc-data-access.md)  
  
-   [Data Exchange for Record Views](../data/data-exchange-for-record-views-mfc-data-access.md)  
  
-   [Your Role in Working with a Record View](../data/your-role-in-working-with-a-record-view-mfc-data-access.md)  
  
-   [Designing and Creating a Record View](../data/designing-and-creating-a-record-view-mfc-data-access.md)
