# Using the OLE/COM Object Viewer
You can use the OLE/COM Object Viewer to view a control's interfaces.  
  
### To use the OLE/COM Object Viewer  
  
1.  Start the OLE/COM Object Viewer (oleview.exe), which is located in the \Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\bin\x86\ folder.  
  
2.  In the **Object Classes, Grouped by Component** category in the viewer, open the **Automation Objects** folder to view the registered Automation objects.  
  
3.  Select one of the controls. Several tabs appear in the right pane; the interfaces that are implemented by the control are displayed on the **Registry** tab.  
  
    -   If you open the shortcut menu for a control in the left pane and then choose **View Type Information**, the ITypeInfo Viewer displays a reconstructed .idl or .odl file.  
  
    -   If you expand the control node in the left pane, a list of the interfaces in the object is displayed. If you select an interface, its registry entry is displayed in the right pane.  
  
    -   If you open the shortcut menu for an interface and then choose **View**, the OLE/COM Object Viewer displays a dialog box that shows the GUID for the interface and an option to view type library information, if it is available. Selecting **View Type Info** displays a portion of a reconstructed .idl file that is specific to the interface in the ITypeInfo Viewer.  
  
    -   In the ITypeInfo Viewer, you can select an interface member in the tree view to display the accessor method signatures in the right pane.
