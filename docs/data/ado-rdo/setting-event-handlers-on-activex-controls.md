# Setting Event Handlers on ActiveX Controls
ActiveX controls can be programmed to respond to events. You can use **ControlEvents** in properties to view the events that are available in a control and to create event handlers. Event handling is commonly done to trap changes in the data source query. Changes include:  
  
-   Implementing a lookup. When a control (like a DBCombo box) changes value, the change event is trapped to update a data control's query.  
  
-   Implementing a master detail relationship. Two data controls are added to a dialog box, one for the master portion and a second for the detail portion. Whenever the first data source changes, the second data source's query is updated through an event handler.  
  
-   Trapping errors. Most controls have an error event from which you can write an error handler (see [Error Trapping](../../data/ado-rdo/error-trapping.md)).  
  
 For more information, see [Mapping Messages to Functions](../../mfc/reference/mapping-messages-to-functions.md).
