# Model for Hosting RDO Data Controls in a Container
A container hosts an RDO data control as follows:  
  
-   The container obtains an IVBDSC interface from the data control. If it cannot find IVBDSC, it is not a data control.  
  
-   The container obtains the **ICursor** interfaces from the data control. These interfaces supply a Cursor object that can be manipulated by a client.  
  
-   The container hooks up to the data control's **INotifyDBEvents** interface. This interface allows the container to receive notifications from the data control. The container should support the **INotifyDBEventsSink** interface to do this.  
  
 A container hosts an RDO data-bound control as follows:  
  
-   The control supports the **IBoundObject** interface and the container supports the **IBoundObjectSite** interface. The control obtains the container's **IBoundObjectSite** interface, and the container obtains the **IBoundObject** interface from the control.  
  
-   The control supports the **IPropNotifySink** interface and hooks up with the container. This allows the container to receive notifications from the control.  
  
-   If the control supports **INotifyDBEventsSink**, it can receive notifications from an RDO data control after connecting with the data control's **INotifyDBEvents** interface.  
  
-   The control then can receive cursor objects from the data control (directly or through the container). The cursors can then be manipulated and scrolled. At this point, the RDO data-bound control is successfully bound.
