# Include Files for Multithreading
Standard include files declare C run-time library functions as they are implemented in the libraries. If you use the [Full Optimization](../build/reference/ox-full-optimization.md) (/Ox) or [fastcall Calling Convention](../build/reference/gd-gr-gv-gz-calling-convention.md) (/Gr) option, the compiler assumes that all functions should be called using the register calling convention. The run-time library functions were compiled using the C calling convention, and the declarations in the standard include files tell the compiler to generate correct external references to these functions.
