# IUMSUnblockNotification Structure
Represents a notification from the Resource Manager that a thread proxy which blocked and triggered a return to the scheduler's designated scheduling context has unblocked and is ready to be scheduled. This interface is invalid once the thread proxy's associated execution context, returned from the `GetContext` method, is rescheduled.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
struct IUMSUnblockNotification;
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[IUMSUnblockNotification::GetContext Method](#getcontext)|Returns the `IExecutionContext` interface for the execution context associated with the thread proxy which has unblocked. Once this method returns and the underlying execution context has been rescheduled via a call to the `IThreadProxy::SwitchTo` method, this interface is no longer valid.|  
|[IUMSUnblockNotification::GetNextUnblockNotification Method](#getnextunblocknotification)|Returns the next `IUMSUnblockNotification` interface in the chain returned from the method `IUMSCompletionList::GetUnblockNotifications`.|  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `IUMSUnblockNotification`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** concrtrm.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="getcontext"></a>  IUMSUnblockNotification::GetContext Method  
 Returns the `IExecutionContext` interface for the execution context associated with the thread proxy which has unblocked. Once this method returns and the underlying execution context has been rescheduled via a call to the `IThreadProxy::SwitchTo` method, this interface is no longer valid.  
  
```
virtual IExecutionContext* GetContext() = 0;
```  
  
### Return Value  
 An `IExecutionContext` interface for the execution context to a thread proxy which has unblocked.  
  
##  <a name="getnextunblocknotification"></a>  IUMSUnblockNotification::GetNextUnblockNotification Method  
 Returns the next `IUMSUnblockNotification` interface in the chain returned from the method `IUMSCompletionList::GetUnblockNotifications`.  
  
```
virtual IUMSUnblockNotification* GetNextUnblockNotification() = 0;
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The next `IUMSUnblockNotification` interface in the chain returned from the method `IUMSCompletionList::GetUnblockNotifications`.
