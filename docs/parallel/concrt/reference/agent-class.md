# agent Class
A class intended to be used as a base class for all independent agents. It is used to hide state from other agents and interact using message-passing.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
class agent;
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[agent::agent Constructor](#ctor)|Overloaded. Constructs an agent.|  
|[agent::~agent Destructor](#dtor)|Destroys the agent.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[agent::cancel Method](#cancel)|Moves an agent from either the `agent_created` or `agent_runnable` states to the `agent_canceled` state.|  
|[agent::start Method](#start)|Moves an agent from the `agent_created` state to the `agent_runnable` state, and schedules it for execution.|  
|[agent::status Method](#status)|A synchronous source of status information from the agent.|  
|[agent::status_port Method](#status_port)|An asynchronous source of status information from the agent.|  
|[agent::wait Method](#wait)|Waits for an agent to complete its task.|  
|[agent::wait_for_all Method](#wait_for_all)|Waits for all of the specified agents to complete their tasks.|  
|[agent::wait_for_one Method](#wait_for_one)|Waits for any one of the specified agents to complete its task.|  
  
### Protected Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[agent::done Method](#done)|Moves an agent into the `agent_done` state, indicating that the agent has completed.|  
|[agent::run Method](#run)|Represents the main task of an agent. `run` should be overridden in a derived class, and specifies what the agent should do after it has been started.|  
  
## Remarks  
 For more information, see [Asynchronous Agents](../../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-agents.md).  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `agent`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="ctor"></a>  agent::agent Constructor  
 Constructs an agent.  
  
```
agent();

agent(Scheduler& _PScheduler);

agent(ScheduleGroup& _PGroup);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The `Scheduler` object within which the execution task of the agent is scheduled.  
  
 `_PGroup`  
 The `ScheduleGroup` object within which the execution task of the agent is scheduled. The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PGroup` parameters.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a>  agent::~agent Destructor  
 Destroys the agent.  
  
```
virtual ~agent();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 It is an error to destroy an agent that is not in a terminal state (either `agent_done` or `agent_canceled`). This can be avoided by waiting for the agent to reach a terminal state in the destructor of a class that inherits from the `agent` class.  
  
##  <a name="cancel"></a>  agent::cancel Method  
 Moves an agent from either the `agent_created` or `agent_runnable` states to the `agent_canceled` state.  
  
```
bool cancel();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the agent was canceled, `false` otherwise. An agent cannot be canceled if it has already started running or has already completed.  
  
##  <a name="done"></a>  agent::done Method  
 Moves an agent into the `agent_done` state, indicating that the agent has completed.  
  
```
bool done();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the agent is moved to the `agent_done` state, `false` otherwise. An agent that has been canceled cannot be moved to the `agent_done` state.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method should be called at the end of the `run` method, when you know the execution of your agent has completed.  
  
##  <a name="run"></a>  agent::run Method  
 Represents the main task of an agent. `run` should be overridden in a derived class, and specifies what the agent should do after it has been started.  
  
```
virtual void run() = 0;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The agent status is changed to `agent_started` right before this method is invoked. The method should invoke `done` on the agent with an appropriate status before returning, and may not throw any exceptions.  
  
##  <a name="start"></a>  agent::start Method  
 Moves an agent from the `agent_created` state to the `agent_runnable` state, and schedules it for execution.  
  
```
bool start();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the agent started correctly, `false` otherwise. An agent that has been canceled cannot be started.  
  
##  <a name="status"></a>  agent::status Method  
 A synchronous source of status information from the agent.  
  
```
agent_status status();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the current state of the agent. Note that this returned state could change immediately after being returned.  
  
##  <a name="status_port"></a>  agent::status_port Method  
 An asynchronous source of status information from the agent.  
  
```
ISource<agent_status>* status_port();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns a message source that can send messages about the current state of the agent.  
  
##  <a name="wait"></a>  agent::wait Method  
 Waits for an agent to complete its task.  
  
```
static agent_status __cdecl wait(
    _Inout_ agent* _PAgent,
    unsigned int _Timeout = COOPERATIVE_TIMEOUT_INFINITE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PAgent`  
 A pointer to the agent to wait for.  
  
 `_Timeout`  
 The maximum time for which to wait, in milliseconds.  
  
### Return Value  
 The `agent_status` of the agent when the wait completes. This can either be `agent_canceled` or `agent_done`.  
  
### Remarks  
 An agent task is completed when the agent enters the `agent_canceled` or `agent_done` states.  
  
 If the parameter `_Timeout` has a value other than the constant `COOPERATIVE_TIMEOUT_INFINITE`, the exception [operation_timed_out](operation-timed-out-class.md) is thrown if the specified amount of time expires before the agent has completed its task.  
  
##  <a name="wait_for_all"></a>  agent::wait_for_all Method  
 Waits for all of the specified agents to complete their tasks.  
  
```
static void __cdecl wait_for_all(
    size_t count,
    _In_reads_(count) agent** _PAgents,
    _Out_writes_opt_(count) agent_status* _PStatus = NULL,
    unsigned int _Timeout = COOPERATIVE_TIMEOUT_INFINITE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `count`  
 The number of agent pointers present in the array `_PAgents`.  
  
 `_PAgents`  
 An array of pointers to the agents to wait for.  
  
 `_PStatus`  
 A pointer to an array of agent statuses. Each status value will represent the status of the corresponding agent when the method returns.  
  
 `_Timeout`  
 The maximum time for which to wait, in milliseconds.  
  
### Remarks  
 An agent task is completed when the agent enters the `agent_canceled` or `agent_done` states.  
  
 If the parameter `_Timeout` has a value other than the constant `COOPERATIVE_TIMEOUT_INFINITE`, the exception [operation_timed_out](operation-timed-out-class.md) is thrown if the specified amount of time expires before the agent has completed its task.  
  
##  <a name="wait_for_one"></a>  agent::wait_for_one Method  
 Waits for any one of the specified agents to complete its task.  
  
```
static void __cdecl wait_for_one(
    size_t count,
    _In_reads_(count) agent** _PAgents,
    agent_status& _Status,
    size_t& _Index,
    unsigned int _Timeout = COOPERATIVE_TIMEOUT_INFINITE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `count`  
 The number of agent pointers present in the array `_PAgents`.  
  
 `_PAgents`  
 An array of pointers to the agents to wait for.  
  
 `_Status`  
 A reference to a variable where the agent status will be placed.  
  
 `_Index`  
 A reference to a variable where the agent index will be placed.  
  
 `_Timeout`  
 The maximum time for which to wait, in milliseconds.  
  
### Remarks  
 An agent task is completed when the agent enters the `agent_canceled` or `agent_done` states.  
  
 If the parameter `_Timeout` has a value other than the constant `COOPERATIVE_TIMEOUT_INFINITE`, the exception [operation_timed_out](operation-timed-out-class.md) is thrown if the specified amount of time expires before the agent has completed its task.
