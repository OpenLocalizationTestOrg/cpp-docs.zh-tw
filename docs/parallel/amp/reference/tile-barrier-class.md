# tile_barrier Class
Synchronizes the execution of threads that are running in the thread group (the tile) by using `wait` methods. Only the runtime can instantiate this class.  
  
### Syntax 
  
```  
class tile_barrier;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[tile_barrier Constructor](#ctor)|Initializes a new instance of the `tile_barrier` class.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[tile_barrier::wait Method](#wait)|Instructs all threads in the thread group (tile) to stop executing until all threads in the tile have finished waiting.|  
|[tile_barrier::wait_with_all_memory_fence Method](#wait_with_all_memory_fence)|Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until all memory accesses have been completed and all threads in the tile have reached this call.|  
|[tile_barrier::wait_with_global_memory_fence Method](#wait_with_global_memory_fence)|Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until all global memory accesses have been completed and all threads in the tile have reached this call.|  
|[tile_barrier::wait_with_tile_static_memory_fence Method](#wait_with_tile_static_memory_fence)|Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until all `tile_static` memory accesses have been completed and all threads in the tile have reached this call.|  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `tile_barrier`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** amp.h  
  
 **Namespace:** Concurrency  

## <a name="tile_barrier__ctor"></a>  tile_barrier Constructor  
 Initializes a new instance of the class by copying an existing one.  
  
### Syntax 
  
```  
tile_barrier(  
    const tile_barrier& _Other ) restrict(amp,cpu);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Other`  
 The `tile_barrier` object to copy.  

## <a name="wait"></a>  wait 
Instructs all threads in the thread group (tile) to stop execution until all threads in the tile have finished waiting.  
  
### Syntax 
  
```  
void wait() const restrict(amp);  
```    

## <a name="wait_with_all_memory_fence"></a>  wait_with_all_memory_fence   
Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until all threads in a tile have reached this call. This ensures that all memory accesses are visible to other threads in the thread tile, and have been executed in program order.  
  
### Syntax 
  
```  
void wait_with_all_memory_fence() const restrict(amp);  
```  
  

## <a name="wait_with_global_memory_fence"></a>  wait_with_global_memory_fence   
Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until all threads in a tile have reached this call. This ensures that all global memory accesses are visible to other threads in the thread tile, and have been executed in program order.  
  
### Syntax 
  
```  
void wait_with_global_memory_fence() const  restrict(amp);  
```

## <a name="wait_with_tile_static_memory_fence"></a>  wait_with_tile_static_memory_fence   
Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until all threads in a tile have reached this call. This ensures that `tile_static`memory accesses are visible to other threads in the thread tile, and have been executed in program order.  
  
### Syntax 
  
```  
void wait_with_tile_static_memory_fence() const restrict(amp);  
```
