# 2.6.4 atomic Construct
The `atomic` directive ensures that a specific memory location is updated atomically, rather than exposing it to the possibility of multiple, simultaneous writing threads. The syntax of the `atomic` directive is as follows:  
  
```  
#pragma omp atomic new-lineexpression-stmt  
```  
  
 The expression statement must have one of the following forms:  
  
 *x binop*= *expr*  
  
 x++  
  
 ++x  
  
 x--  
  
 --x  
  
 In the preceding expressions:  
  
-   *x* is an lvalue expression with scalar type.  
  
-   *expr* is an expression with scalar type, and it does not reference the object designated by *x*.  
  
-   `binop` is not an overloaded operator and is one of  +, *, -, /, &, ^, &#124;, <\<, or   >>.  
  
 Although it is implementation-defined whether an implementation replaces all `atomic` directives with **critical** directives that have the same unique *name*, the `atomic` directive permits better optimization. Often hardware instructions are available that can perform the atomic update with the least overhead.  
  
 Only the load and store of the object designated by *x* are atomic; the evaluation of *expr* is not atomic. To avoid race conditions, all updates of the location in parallel should be protected with the `atomic` directive, except those that are known to be free of race conditions.  
  
 Restrictions to the `atomic` directive are as follows:  
  
-   All atomic references to the storage location x throughout the program are required to have a compatible type.  
  
## Examples:  
  
```  
extern float a[], *p = a, b;  
/* Protect against races among multiple updates. */  
#pragma omp atomic  
a[index[i]] += b;  
/* Protect against races with updates through a. */  
#pragma omp atomic  
p[i] -= 1.0f;  
  
extern union {int n; float x;} u;  
/* ERROR - References through incompatible types. */  
#pragma omp atomic  
u.n++;  
#pragma omp atomic  
u.x -= 1.0f;  
```
