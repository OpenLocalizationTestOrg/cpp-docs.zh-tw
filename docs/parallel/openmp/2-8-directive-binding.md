# 2.8 Directive Binding
Dynamic binding of directives must adhere to the following rules:  
  
-   The **for**, **sections**, **single**, **master**, and **barrier** directives bind to the dynamically enclosing **parallel**, if one exists, regardless of the value of any **if** clause that may be present on that directive. If no parallel region is currently being executed, the directives are executed by a team composed of only the master thread.  
  
-   The **ordered** directive binds to the dynamically enclosing **for**.  
  
-   The **atomic** directive enforces exclusive access with respect to **atomic** directives in all threads, not just the current team.  
  
-   The **critical** directive enforces exclusive access with respect to **critical** directives in all threads, not just the current team.  
  
-   A directive can never bind to any directive outside the closest dynamically enclosing **parallel**.
