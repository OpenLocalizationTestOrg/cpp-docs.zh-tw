# 1.4 Compliance
An implementation of the OpenMP C/C++ API is *OpenMP-compliant* if it recognizes and preserves the semantics of all the elements of this specification, as laid out in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and Appendix C. Appendices A, B, D, E, and F are for information purposes only and are not part of the specification. Implementations that include only a subset of the API are not OpenMP-compliant.  
  
 The OpenMP C and C++ API is an extension to the base language that is supported by an implementation. If the base language does not support a language construct or extension that appears in this document, the OpenMP implementation is not required to support it.  
  
 All standard C and C++ library functions and built-in functions (that is, functions of which the compiler has specific knowledge) must be thread-safe. Unsynchronized use of threadâ€“safe functions by different threads inside a parallel region does not produce undefined behavior. However, the behavior might not be the same as in a serial region. (A random number generation function is an example.)  
  
 The OpenMP C/C++ API specifies that certain behavior is *implementation-defined.* A conforming OpenMP implementation is required to define and document its behavior in these cases. See [Appendix E](../../parallel/openmp/e-implementation-defined-behaviors-in-openmp-c-cpp.md), page 97, for a list of implementation-defined behaviors.
