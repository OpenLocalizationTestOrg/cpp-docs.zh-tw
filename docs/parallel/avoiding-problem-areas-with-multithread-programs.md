# Avoiding Problem Areas with Multithread Programs
There are several problems you might encounter in creating, linking, or executing a multithread C program. Some of the more common problems are described in the following table. (For a similar discussion from the MFC point of view, see [Multithreading: Programming Tips](../parallel/multithreading-programming-tips.md).)  
  
|Problem|Probable cause|  
|-------------|--------------------|  
|You get a message box showing that your program caused a protection violation.|Many Win32 programming errors cause protection violations. A common cause of protection violations is the indirect assignment of data to null pointers. Because this results in your program trying to access memory that does not belong to it, a protection violation is issued.<br /><br /> An easy way to detect the cause of a protection violation is to compile your program with debugging information and then run it through the debugger in the Visual C++ environment. When the protection fault occurs, Windows transfers control to the debugger and the cursor is positioned on the line that caused the problem.|  
|Your program generates numerous compile and link errors.|You can eliminate many potential problems by setting the compiler's warning level to one of its highest values and heeding the warning messages. By using the level 3 or level 4 warning level options, you can detect unintentional data conversions, missing function prototypes, and use of non-ANSI features.|
