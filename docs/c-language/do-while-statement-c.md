# do-while Statement (C)
The `do-while` statement lets you repeat a statement or compound statement until a specified expression becomes false.  
  
## Syntax  
 *iteration-statement*:  
 **do**  *statement*  **while (**  *expression*  **) ;**  
  
 The *expression* in a `do-while` statement is evaluated after the body of the loop is executed. Therefore, the body of the loop is always executed at least once.  
  
 The *expression* must have arithmetic or pointer type. Execution proceeds as follows:  
  
1.  The statement body is executed.  
  
2.  Next, *expression* is evaluated. If *expression* is false, the `do-while` statement terminates and control passes to the next statement in the program. If *expression* is true (nonzero), the process is repeated, beginning with step 1.  
  
 The `do-while` statement can also terminate when a **break**, `goto`, or `return` statement is executed within the statement body.  
  
 This is an example of the `do-while` statement:  
  
```  
do   
{  
    y = f( x );  
    x--;  
} while ( x > 0 );  
```  
  
 In this `do-while` statement, the two statements `y = f( x );` and `x--;` are executed, regardless of the initial value of `x`. Then `x > 0` is evaluated. If `x` is greater than 0, the statement body is executed again and `x > 0` is reevaluated. The statement body is executed repeatedly as long as `x` remains greater than 0. Execution of the `do-while` statement terminates when `x` becomes 0 or negative. The body of the loop is executed at least once.
