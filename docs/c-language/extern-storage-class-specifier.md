# extern Storage-Class Specifier
A variable declared with the `extern` storage-class specifier is a reference to a variable with the same name defined at the external level in any of the source files of the program. The internal `extern` declaration is used to make the external-level variable definition visible within the block. Unless otherwise declared at the external level, a variable declared with the `extern` keyword is visible only in the block in which it is declared.  
  
## Example  
 This example illustrates internal- and external-level declarations:  
  
```  
// extern_StorageClassSpecified.c  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
void other( void );  
  
int main()  
{  
    // Reference to i, defined below:   
    extern int i;  
  
    // Initial value is zero; a is visible only within main:   
    static int a;  
  
    // b is stored in a register, if possible:   
    register int b = 0;  
  
    // Default storage class is auto:   
    int c = 0;  
  
    // Values printed are 1, 0, 0, 0:   
    printf_s( "%d\n%d\n%d\n%d\n", i, a, b, c );  
    other();  
    return;  
}  
  
int i = 1;  
  
void other( void )  
{  
    // Address of global i assigned to pointer variable:  
    static int *external_i = &i;  
  
    // i is redefined; global i no longer visible:   
    int i = 16;  
  
    // This a is visible only within the other function:   
    static int a = 2;  
  
    a += 2;  
    // Values printed are 16, 4, and 1:  
    printf_s( "%d\n%d\n%d\n", i, a, *external_i );  
}  
```  
  
 In this example, the variable `i` is defined at the external level with initial value 1. An `extern` declaration in the `main` function is used to declare a reference to the external-level `i`. The **static** variable `a` is initialized to 0 by default, since the initializer is omitted. The call to `printf` prints the values 1, 0, 0, and 0.  
  
 In the `other` function, the address of the global variable `i` is used to initialize the **static** pointer variable `external_i`. This works because the global variable has **static** lifetime, meaning its address does not change during program execution. Next, the variable `i` is redefined as a local variable with initial value 16. This redefinition does not affect the value of the external-level `i`, which is hidden by the use of its name for the local variable. The value of the global `i` is now accessible only indirectly within this block, through the pointer `external_i`. Attempting to assign the address of the **auto** variable `i` to a pointer does not work, since it may be different each time the block is entered. The variable `a` is declared as a **static** variable and initialized to 2. This `a` does not conflict with the `a` in `main`, since **static** variables at the internal level are visible only within the block in which they are declared.  
  
 The variable `a` is increased by 2, giving 4 as the result. If the `other` function were called again in the same program, the initial value of `a` would be 4. Internal **static** variables keep their values when the program exits and then reenters the block in which they are declared.
