# Conversions from Floating-Point Types
A **float** value converted to a **double** or `long double`, or a **double** converted to a `long double`, undergoes no change in value. A **double** value converted to a **float** value is represented exactly, if possible. Precision may be lost if the value cannot be represented exactly. If the result is out of range, the behavior is undefined. See [Limits on Floating-Point Constants](../c-language/limits-on-floating-point-constants.md) for the range of floating-point types.  
  
 A floating value is converted to an integral value by first converting to a **long**, then from the **long** value to the specific integral value. The decimal portion of the floating value is discarded in the conversion to a **long**. If the result is still too large to fit into a **long**, the result of the conversion is undefined.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 When converting a **double** or `long double` floating-point number to a smaller floating-point number, the value of the floating-point variable is truncated toward zero when an underflow occurs. An overflow causes a run-time error. Note that the Microsoft C compiler maps `long double` to type **double**.  
  
 **END Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The following table summarizes conversions from floating types.  
  
### Conversions from Floating-Point Types  
  
|From|To|Method|  
|----------|--------|------------|  
|**float**|`char`|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to `char`|  
|**float**|**short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **short**|  
|**float**|**long**|Truncate at decimal point. If result is too large to be represented as **long**, result is undefined.|  
|**float**|**unsigned short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to `unsigned` **short**|  
|**float**|`unsigned long`|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to `unsigned` **long**|  
|**float**|**double**|Change internal representation|  
|**float**|`long double`|Change internal representation|  
|**double**|`char`|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to `char`|  
|**double**|**short**|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to **short**|  
|**double**|**long**|Truncate at decimal point. If result is too large to be represented as **long**, result is undefined.|  
|**double**|**unsigned short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **unsigned short**|  
|**double**|`unsigned long`|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to `unsigned` **long**|  
|**double**|**float**|Represent as a **float**. If **double** value cannot be represented exactly as **float**, loss of precision occurs. If value is too large to be represented as **float**, the result is undefined.|  
|`long double`|`char`|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to `char`|  
|`long double`|**short**|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to **short**|  
|`long double`|**long**|Truncate at decimal point. If result is too large to be represented as **long**, result is undefined.|  
|`long double`|**unsigned short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to `unsigned` **short**|  
|`long double`|`unsigned long`|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to `unsigned` **long**|  
|`long double`|**float**|Represent as a **float**. If **double** value cannot be represented exactly as **float**, loss of precision occurs. If value is too large to be represented as **float**, the result is undefined.|  
|`long double`|**double**|The **long double** value is treated as **double**.|  
  
 Conversions from **float**, **double**, or `long double` values to `unsigned long` are not accurate if the value being converted is larger than the maximum positive **long** value.
