# Using the Additive Operators
The following examples, which illustrate the addition and subtraction operators, use these declarations:  
  
```  
int i = 4, j;  
float x[10];  
float *px;  
```  
  
 These statements are equivalent:  
  
```  
px = &x[4 + i];  
px = &x[4] + i;    
```  
  
 The value of `i` is multiplied by the length of a **float** and added to `&x[4]`. The resulting pointer value is the address of `x[8]`.  
  
```  
j = &x[i] - &x[i-2];  
```  
  
 In this example, the address of the third element of `x` (given by `x[iâ€“2]`) is subtracted from the address of the fifth element of `x` (given by `x[i]`). The difference is divided by the length of a **float**; the result is the integer value 2.
