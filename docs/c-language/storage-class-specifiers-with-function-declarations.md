# Storage-Class Specifiers with Function Declarations
You can use either the **static** or the `extern` storage-class specifier in function declarations. Functions always have global lifetimes.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Function declarations at the internal level have the same meaning as function declarations at the external level. This means that a function is visible from its point of declaration throughout the rest of the translation unit even if it is declared at local scope.  
  
 **END Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The visibility rules for functions vary slightly from the rules for variables, as follows:  
  
-   A function declared to be **static** is visible only within the source file in which it is defined. Functions in the same source file can call the **static** function, but functions in other source files cannot access it directly by name. You can declare another **static** function with the same name in a different source file without conflict.  
  
-   Functions declared as `extern` are visible throughout all source files in the program (unless you later redeclare such a function as **static**). Any function can call an `extern` function.  
  
-   Function declarations that omit the storage-class specifier are `extern` by default.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Microsoft allows redefinition of an `extern` identifier as **static**.  
  
 **END Microsoft Specific**
