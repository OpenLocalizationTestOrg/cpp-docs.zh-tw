# Declarations and Types
This section describes the declaration and initialization of variables, functions, and types. The C language includes a standard set of basic data types. You can also add your own data types, called "derived types," by declaring new ones based on types already defined. The following topics are discussed:  
  
-   [Overview of declarations](../c-language/overview-of-declarations.md)  
  
-   [Storage classes](../c-language/c-storage-classes.md)  
  
-   [Type specifiers](../c-language/c-type-specifiers.md)  
  
-   [Type qualifiers](../c-language/type-qualifiers.md)  
  
-   [Declarators and variable declarations](../c-language/declarators-and-variable-declarations.md)  
  
-   [Interpreting more complex declarators](../c-language/interpreting-more-complex-declarators.md)  
  
-   [Initialization](../c-language/initialization.md)  
  
-   [Storage of basic types](../c-language/storage-of-basic-types.md)  
  
-   [Incomplete types](../c-language/incomplete-types.md)  
  
-   [Typedef declarations](../c-language/typedef-declarations.md)  
  
-   [Extended storage-class attributes](../c-language/c-extended-storage-class-attributes.md)
