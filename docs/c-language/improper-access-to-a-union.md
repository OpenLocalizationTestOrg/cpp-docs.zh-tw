# Improper Access to a Union
**ANSI 3.3.2.3** A member of a union object is accessed using a member of a different type  
  
 If a union of two types is declared and one value is stored, but the union is accessed with the other type, the results are unreliable.  
  
 For example, a union of **float** and `int` is declared. A **float** value is stored, but the program later accesses the value as an `int`. In such a situation, the value would depend on the internal storage of **float** values. The integer value would not be reliable.
