# CAdapt Class
This template is used to wrap classes that redefine the address-of operator to return something other than the address of the object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template <class T>  class CAdapt
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `T`  
 The adapted type.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CAdapt::CAdapt](#cadapt__cadapt)|The constructor.|  
  
### Public Operators  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CAdapt::operator const T&](#cadapt__operator_const_t_amp)|Returns a `const` reference to `m_T`.|  
|[CAdapt::operator T&](#cadapt__operator_t_amp)|Returns a reference to `m_T`.|  
|[CAdapt::operator <](#cadapt__operator_lt)|Compares an object of the adapted type with `m_T`.|  
|[CAdapt::operator =](#cadapt__operator_eq)|Assigns an object of the adapted type to `m_T`.|  
|[CAdapt::operator ==](#cadapt__operator_eq_eq)|Compares an object of the adapted type with `m_T`.|  
  
### Public Data Members  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CAdapt::m_T](#cadapt__m_t)|The data being adapted.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `CAdapt` is a simple template used to wrap classes that redefine the address-of operator ( `operator &`) to return something other than the address of the object. Examples of such classes include ATL's `CComBSTR`, `CComPtr`, and `CComQIPtr` classes, and the compiler COM support class, `_com_ptr_t`. These classes all redefine the address-of operator to return the address of one of their data members (a `BSTR` in the case of `CComBSTR`, and an interface pointer in the case of the other classes).  
  
 `CAdapt`'s primary role is to hide the address-of operator defined by class `T`, yet still retain the characteristics of the adapted class. `CAdapt` fulfils this role by holding a public member, [m_T](#cadapt__m_t), of type `T`, and by defining conversion operators, comparison operators, and a copy constructor to allow specializations of `CAdapt` to be treated as if they are objects of type `T`.  
  
 The adapter class `CAdapt` is useful because some container-style classes expect to be able to obtain the addresses of their contained objects using the address-of operator. The redefinition of the address-of operator can confound this requirement, typically causing compilation errors and preventing the use of the non-adapted type with classes that expect it to "just work". `CAdapt` provides a way around those problems.  
  
 Typically, you will use `CAdapt` when you want to store `CComBSTR`, `CComPtr`, `CComQIPtr`, or `_com_ptr_t` objects in a container-style class. This was most commonly necessary for C++ Standard Library containers prior to support for the C++11 Standard, but C++11 Standard Library containers automatically work with types that have overloaded `operator&()`. The Standard Library achieves this by internally using [std::addressof()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6243ddc8-486a-4961-8b0c-33e9dc2e0648) to get the true addresses of objects.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlcomcli.h  
  
##  <a name="cadapt__cadapt"></a>  CAdapt::CAdapt  
 The constructors allow an adapter object to be default constructed, copied from an object of the adapted type, or copied from another adapter object.  
  
```
CAdapt();
CAdapt(const T& rSrc);

    CAdapt(const CAdapt& rSrCA);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `rSrc`  
 A variable of the type being adapted to be copied into the newly constructed adapter object.  
  
 *rSrCA*  
 An adapter object whose contained data should be copied into the newly constructed adapter object.  
  
##  <a name="cadapt__m_t"></a>  CAdapt::m_T  
 Holds the data being adapted.  
  
```
T m_T;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 This **public** data member can be accessed directly or indirectly with [operator const T&](#cadapt__operator_const_t_amp) and [operator T&](#cadapt__operator_t_amp).  
  
##  <a name="cadapt__operator_const_t_amp"></a>  CAdapt::operator const T&amp;  
 Returns a **const** reference to the [m_T](#cadapt__m_t) member, allowing the adapter object to be treated as if it were an object of type `T`.  
  
```operator const T&() const;
```  
  
### Return Value  
 A **const** reference to `m_T`.  
  
##  <a name="cadapt__operator_t_amp"></a>  CAdapt::operator T&amp;  
 Returns a reference to the [m_T](#cadapt__m_t) member, allowing the adapter object to be treated as if it were an object of type `T`.  
  
```operator T&();
```     
  
### Return Value  
 A reference to `m_T`.  
  
##  <a name="cadapt__operator_lt"></a>  CAdapt::operator &lt;  
 Compares an object of the adapted type with [m_T](#cadapt__m_t).  
  
```
bool operator<(const T& rSrc) const;
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `rSrc`  
 A reference to the object to be compared.  
  
### Return Value  
 The result of the comparison between `m_T` and `rSrc`.  
  
##  <a name="cadapt__operator_eq"></a>  CAdapt::operator =  
 The assignment operator assigns the argument, `rSrc`, to the data member [m_T](#cadapt__m_t) and returns the current adapter object.  
  
```
CAdapt& operator= (const T& rSrc);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `rSrc`  
 A reference to an object of the adapted type to be copied.  
  
### Return Value  
 A reference to the current object.  
  
##  <a name="cadapt__operator_eq_eq"></a>  CAdapt::operator ==  
 Compares an object of the adapted type with [m_T](#cadapt__m_t).  
  
```
bool operator== (const T& rSrc) const;
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `rSrc`  
 A reference to the object to be compared.  
  
### Return Value  
 The result of the comparison between `m_T` and `rSrc`.
