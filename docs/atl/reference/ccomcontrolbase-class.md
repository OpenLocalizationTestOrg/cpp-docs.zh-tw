## Remarks  
 This class provides methods for creating and managing ATL controls. [CComControl Class](../../atl/reference/ccomcontrol-class.md) derives from `CComControlBase`. When you create a Standard Control or DHTML control using the ATL Control Wizard, the wizard will automatically derive your class from `CComControlBase`.  
  
 For more information about creating a control, see the [ATL Tutorial](../../atl/active-template-library-atl-tutorial.md). For more information about the ATL Project Wizard, see the article [Creating an ATL Project](../../atl/reference/creating-an-atl-project.md).

The control's container must implement an advise sink by supporting the [IAdviseSink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692513) interface.  
  
##  <a name="ccomcontrolbase__m_spinplacesite"></a>  CComControlBase::m_spInPlaceSite  
 A pointer to the container's [IOleInPlaceSite](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686586), [IOleInPlaceSiteEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms693461), or [IOleInPlaceSiteWindowless](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms682300) interface pointer.  
  
```
CComPtr<IOleInPlaceSiteWindowless>
    m_spInPlaceSite;
```     
  
### Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use this data member within your control class, you must declare it as a data member in your control class. Your control class will not inherit this data member from the base class because it is declared within a union in the base class.  
  
 The `m_spInPlaceSite` pointer is valid only if the [m_bNegotiatedWnd](#ccomcontrolbase__m_bnegotiatedwnd) flag is **TRUE**.  
  
 The following table shows how the `m_spInPlaceSite` pointer type depends on the [m_bWndLess](#ccomcontrolbase__m_bwndless) and [m_bInPlaceSiteEx](#ccomcontrolbase__m_binplacesiteex) data member flags:  
  
|m_spInPlaceSite Type|m_bWndLess Value|m_bInPlaceSiteEx Value|  
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|  
|**IOleInPlaceSiteWindowless**|**TRUE**|**TRUE** or **FALSE**|  
|**IOleInPlaceSiteEx**|**FALSE**|**TRUE**|  
|`IOleInPlaceSite`|**FALSE**|**FALSE**|  
  
##  <a name="ccomcontrolbase__m_spoleadviseholder"></a>  CComControlBase::m_spOleAdviseHolder  
 Provides a standard implementation of a way to hold advisory connections.  
  
```
CComPtr<IOleAdviseHolder>
    m_spOleAdviseHolder;
```     
  
### Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use this data member within your control class, you must declare it as a data member in your control class. Your control class will not inherit this data member from the base class because it is declared within a union in the base class.  
  
 The interface `m_spOleAdviseHolder` implements the [IOleObject::Advise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686573) and [IOleObject::Unadvise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms693749) methods to establish and delete advisory connections to the container. The control's container must implement an advise sink by supporting the [IAdviseSink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692513) interface.  
  
##  <a name="ccomcontrolbase__ondraw"></a>  CComControlBase::OnDraw  
 Override this method to draw your control.  
  
```
virtual HRESULT OnDraw(ATL_DRAWINFO& di);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `di`  
 A reference to the [ATL_DRAWINFO](../../atl/reference/atl-drawinfo-structure.md) structure that contains drawing information such as the draw aspect, the control bounds, and whether the drawing is optimized or not.  
  
### Return Value  
 A standard `HRESULT` value.  
  
### Remarks  
 The default `OnDraw` deletes or restores the device context or does nothing, depending on flags set in [CComControlBase::OnDrawAdvanced](#ccomcontrolbase__ondrawadvanced).  
  
 An `OnDraw` method is automatically added to your control class when you create your control with the ATL Control Wizard. The wizard's default `OnDraw` draws a rectangle with the label "ATL 8.0".  
  
### Example  
 See the example for [CComControlBase::GetAmbientAppearance](#ccomcontrolbase__getambientappearance).  
  
##  <a name="ccomcontrolbase__ondrawadvanced"></a>  CComControlBase::OnDrawAdvanced  
 The default `OnDrawAdvanced` prepares a normalized device context for drawing, then calls your control class's `OnDraw` method.  
  
```
virtual HRESULT OnDrawAdvanced(ATL_DRAWINFO& di);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `di`  
 A reference to the [ATL_DRAWINFO](../../atl/reference/atl-drawinfo-structure.md) structure that contains drawing information such as the draw aspect, the control bounds, and whether the drawing is optimized or not.  
  
### Return Value  
 A standard `HRESULT` value.  
  
### Remarks  
 Override this method if you want to accept the device context passed by the container without normalizing it.  
  
 See [CComControlBase::OnDraw](#ccomcontrolbase__ondraw) for more details.  
  
##  <a name="ccomcontrolbase__onkillfocus"></a>  CComControlBase::OnKillFocus
