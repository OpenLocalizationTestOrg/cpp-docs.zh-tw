# IWorkerThreadClient Interface
`IWorkerThreadClient` is the interface implemented by clients of the [CWorkerThread](../../atl/reference/cworkerthread-class.md) class.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)].  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
__interface IWorkerThreadClient
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Methods  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[CloseHandle](#iworkerthreadclient__closehandle)|Implement this method to close the handle associated with this object.|  
|[Execute](#iworkerthreadclient__execute)|Implement this method to execute code when the handle associated with this object becomes signaled.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Implement this interface when you have code that needs to execute on a worker thread in response to a handle becoming signaled.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlutil.h  
  
##  <a name="iworkerthreadclient__closehandle"></a>  IWorkerThreadClient::CloseHandle  
 Implement this method to close the handle associated with this object.  
  
```
HRESULT CloseHandle(HANDLE    hHandle);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *hHandle*  
 The handle to be closed.  
  
### Return Value  
 Return S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 The handle passed to this method was previously associated with this object by a call to [CWorkerThread::AddHandle](../../atl/reference/cworkerthread-class.md#cworkerthread__addhandle).  
  
### Example  
 The following code shows a simple implementation of `IWorkerThreadClient::CloseHandle`.  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Utilities#135](../../atl/codesnippet/cpp/iworkerthreadclient-interface_1.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="iworkerthreadclient__execute"></a>  IWorkerThreadClient::Execute  
 Implement this method to execute code when the handle associated with this object becomes signaled.  
  
```
HRESULT Execute(
    DWORD_PTR
dwParam,
 HANDLE   hObject);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `dwParam`  
 The user parameter.  
  
 `hObject`  
 The handle that has become signaled.  
  
### Return Value  
 Return S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 The handle and DWORD/pointer passed to this method were previously associated with this object by a call to [CWorkerThread::AddHandle](../../atl/reference/cworkerthread-class.md#cworkerthread__addhandle).  
  
### Example  
 The following code shows a simple implementation of `IWorkerThreadClient::Execute`.  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Utilities#136](../../atl/codesnippet/cpp/iworkerthreadclient-interface_2.cpp)]
