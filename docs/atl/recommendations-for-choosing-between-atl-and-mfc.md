# Recommendations for Choosing Between ATL and MFC
When developing components and applications, you can choose between two approaches â€” ATL and MFC (the Microsoft Foundation Class Library).  
  
## Using ATL  
 ATL is a fast, easy way to both create a COM component in C++ and maintain a small footprint. Use ATL to create a control if you don't need all of the built-in functionality that MFC automatically provides.  
  
## Using MFC  
 MFC allows you to create full applications, ActiveX controls, and active documents. If you have already created a control with MFC, you may want to continue development in MFC. When creating a new control, consider using ATL if you don't need all of MFC's built-in functionality.  
  
## Using ATL in an MFC Project  
 You can add support for using ATL in an existing MFC project by running a wizard. For details, see [Adding ATL Support to Your MFC Project](../mfc/reference/adding-atl-support-to-your-mfc-project.md).
