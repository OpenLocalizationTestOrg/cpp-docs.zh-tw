# Running the Program as a Local Server
If running the program as a service is inconvenient, you can temporarily change the registry so that the program is run as a normal local server. Simply rename the `LocalService` value under your AppID to `_LocalService` and ensure the `LocalServer32` key under your CLSID is set correctly. (Note that using DCOMCNFG to specify that your application should be run on a different computer renames your `LocalServer32` key to `_LocalServer32`.) Running your program as a local server takes a few more seconds on startup because the call to **StartServiceCtrlDispatcher** in `CAtlServiceModuleT::Start` takes a few seconds before it fails.
