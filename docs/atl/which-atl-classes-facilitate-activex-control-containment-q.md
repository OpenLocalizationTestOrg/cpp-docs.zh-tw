# Which ATL Classes Facilitate ActiveX Control Containment?
ATL's control-hosting code doesn't require you to use any ATL classes; you can simply create an **"AtlAxWin80"** window and use the control-hosting API if necessary (for more information, see **What Is the ATL Control-Hosting API**. However, the following classes make the containment features easier to use.  
  
|Class|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[CAxWindow](../atl/reference/caxwindow-class.md)|Wraps an **"AtlAxWin80"** window, providing methods for creating the window, creating a control and/or attaching a control to the window, and retrieving interface pointers on the host object.|  
|[CAxWindow2T](../atl/reference/caxwindow2t-class.md)|Wraps an **"AtlAxWinLic80"** window, providing methods for creating the window, creating a control and/or attaching a licensed control to the window, and retrieving interface pointers on the host object.|  
|[CComCompositeControl](../atl/reference/ccomcompositecontrol-class.md)|Acts as a base class for ActiveX control classes based on a dialog resource. Such controls can contain other ActiveX controls.|  
|[CAxDialogImpl](../atl/reference/caxdialogimpl-class.md)|Acts as a base class for dialog classes based on a dialog resource. Such dialogs can contain ActiveX controls.|  
|[CWindow](../atl/reference/cwindow-class.md)|Provides a method, [GetDlgControl](../atl/reference/cwindow-class.md#cwindow__getdlgcontrol), that will return an interface pointer on a control, given the ID of its host window. In addition, the Windows API wrappers exposed by `CWindow` generally make window management easier.|
