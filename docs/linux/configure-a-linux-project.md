# Configure a Linux Project

## General Settings
A variety of options can be set when building a Linux project with Visual Studio.  To view these options, select the **Project > Properties** menu, or right click on the project in *Solution Explorer* and select **Properties** from the context menu.

By default, an executable (.out) is built with the tool.  To build a static or dynamic library, or to use an existing Makefile, use the **Configuration Type** selection.

## Remote Settings
To change settings pertaining to the remote Linux computer, select the **Remote settings** item in the *Property Pages* dialog box.

* To change the target Linux computer, use the **Target machine** entry.  This will allow you to select one of the connections created previously.  To create a new entry, please see the [Connecting to Your Remote Linux Computer](connect.md) section.

* The **Remote Root Directory** determines the root location of where the project is built on the remote Linux device.  This will default to **~/projects** unless changed.

* The **Remote Project Directory** is where this specific project will be built on the remote Linux device.  This will default to **$(RemoteRootDir)/$(ProjectName)**, which will expand to a directory named after the current project, under the root directory set above.

* Finally, to change the default C and C++ compilers, or the Linker and Archiver used to build the project, use the appropriate entries in the **Tools Defaults** section.  These could be set to use a certain version of GCC, or even the Clang compiler, for example.

## VC++ Directories
By default, Visual Studio does not include any system-level include files from the Linux device, for example, items in the **/usr/include** directory.  For full IntelliSense support in Visual Studio, you will need to copy those files to some location on your development computer and point Visual Studio to this location.  One option is to use scp (Secure Copy) to copy the files.  On Windows 10, you can use [Bash on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about) to run scp.  For previous versions of Windows, you could use something like [PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy)](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

You can copy the files by using a command like the following:

`scp -r linux_username@remote_host:/usr/include .`

Of course, replace the *linux_user* and *remote_host* values above for what's appropriate in your own environment.

Once the files are copied, use the **VC++ Directories** item in Project properties to tell Visual Studio where to find the additional include files that were just copied.

## Copy Sources
When building, the source files on your development PC are copied to the Linux device and compiled there.  By default, all sources in the Visual Studio project are copied to the locations set in the settings above.  However, additional sources can also be added to the list, or copying sources can be turned off entirely, which is the default for a Makefile project.

* **Sources to copy** determines which sources are copied to the remote device.  By default, the *@(SourcesToCopyRemotely)* defaults to all files in the project.

* **Copy sources** can be turned on and off to enable and disable the copying of source files to the remote device.

* **Additional sources to copy** allows you to add additional source files which will be copied to the remote system.  You can specify a semi-colon delimited list, or you can use the **:=** syntax to specify a local and remote name to use:

  `C:\Projects\ConsoleApplication1\MyFile.cpp:=~/projects/ConsoleApplication1/ADifferentName.cpp;C:\Projects\ConsoleApplication1\MyFile2.cpp:=~/projects/ConsoleApplication1/ADifferentName2.cpp;`

## Build Events
Since all compilation is happening on a remote device, several additional Build Events have been added to the Build Events section in Project Properties.  These are **Remote Pre-Build Event**, **Remote Pre-Link Event**, and **Remove Post-Build Event**, and will occur on the remote device before or after the individual steps in the process.
