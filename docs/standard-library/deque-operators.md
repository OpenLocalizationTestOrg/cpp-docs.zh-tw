##  <a name="operator_neq"></a>  operator!=  
 Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the deque object on the right side.  
  
```
bool operator!=(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `left`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
 `right`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
### Return Value  
 **true** if the deque objects are not equal; **false** if the deque objects are equal.  
  
### Remarks  
 The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. Two deque objects are equal if they have the same number of elements and their respective elements have the same values. Otherwise, they are unequal.  
  
### Example  
  
```cpp  
// deque_op_ne.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <deque>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;   
   deque <int> c1, c2;  
  
   c1.push_back( 1 );  
   c2.push_back( 2 );  
  
   if ( c1 != c2 )  
      cout << "The deques are not equal." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The deques are equal." << endl;  
}  
\* Output:   
The deques are not equal.  
*\  
```  
  
##  <a name="operator_lt_"></a>  operator&lt;  
 Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than the deque object on the right side.  
  
```
bool operator<(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `left`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
 `right`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
### Return Value  
 **true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is less than and not equal to the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.  
  
### Remarks  
 The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The less-than relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.  
  
### Example  
  
```cpp  
// deque_op_lt.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <deque>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;   
   deque <int> c1, c2;  
  
   c1.push_back( 1 );  
   c1.push_back( 2 );  
   c1.push_back( 4 );  
  
   c2.push_back( 1 );  
   c2.push_back( 3 );  
  
   if ( c1 < c2 )  
      cout << "Deque c1 is less than deque c2." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "Deque c1 is not less than deque c2." << endl;  
}  
\* Output:   
Deque c1 is less than deque c2.  
*\   
```  
  
##  <a name="operator_lt__eq"></a>  operator&lt;=  
 Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the deque object on the right side.  
  
```
bool operator<=(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `left`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
 `right`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
### Return Value  
 **true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.  
  
### Remarks  
 The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The less than or equal to relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.  
  
### Example  
  
```cpp  
// deque_op_le.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <deque>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;   
   deque <int> c1, c2;  
  
   c1.push_back( 1 );  
   c1.push_back( 2 );  
   c1.push_back( 4 );  
  
   c2.push_back( 1 );  
   c2.push_back( 3 );  
  
   if ( c1 <= c2 )  
      cout << "Deque c1 is less than or equal to deque c2." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "Deque c1 is greater than deque c2." << endl;  
}  
\* Output:   
Deque c1 is less than or equal to deque c2.  
*\  
  
```  
  
##  <a name="operator_eq_eq"></a>  operator==  
 Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is equal to the deque object on the right side.  
  
```
bool operator==(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `left`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
 `right`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
### Return Value  
 **true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is equal to the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.  
  
### Remarks  
 The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. Two deques are equal if they have the same number of elements and their respective elements have the same values. Otherwise, they are unequal.  
  
### Example  
  
```cpp  
// deque_op_eq.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <deque>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;  
   deque <int> c1, c2;  
  
   c1.push_back( 1 );  
   c2.push_back( 1 );  
  
   if ( c1 == c2 )  
      cout << "The deques are equal." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The deques are not equal." << endl;  
  
   c1.push_back( 1 );  
   if ( c1 == c2 )  
      cout << "The deques are equal." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The deques are not equal." << endl;  
}  
\* Output:   
The deques are equal.  
The deques are not equal.  
*\  
  
```  
  
##  <a name="operator_gt_"></a>  operator&gt;  
 Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is greater than the deque object on the right side.  
  
```
bool operator>(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `left`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
 `right`  
 An object of type `deque`.  
  
### Return Value  
 **true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is greater than the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.  
  
### Remarks  
 The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The greater-than relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.  
  
### Example  
  
```cpp  
// deque_op_gt.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <deque>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;   
   deque <int> c1, c2;  
  
   c1.push_back( 1 );  
   c1.push_back( 3 );  
   c1.push_back( 1 );
