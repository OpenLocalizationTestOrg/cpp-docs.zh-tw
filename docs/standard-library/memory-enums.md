##  <a name="pointer_safety_enumeration"></a>  pointer_safety Enumeration  
 The enumeration of possible values returned by `get_pointer_safety`.  
  
class pointer_safety { relaxed, preferred, strict };  
  
### Remarks  
 The scoped `enum` defines the values that can be returned by `get_pointer_safety``()`:  
  
 `relaxed` -- pointers not safely derived (obviously pointers to declared or allocated objects) are treated the same as those safely derived.  
  
 `preferred` -- as before, but pointers not safely derived should not be dereferenced.  
  
 `strict` -- pointers not safely derived might be treated differently than those safely derived.
