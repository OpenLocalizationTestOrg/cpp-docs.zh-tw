# basic_filebuf Class
Describes a stream buffer that controls the transmission of elements of type `Elem`, whose character traits are determined by the class `Tr`, to and from a sequence of elements stored in an external file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template <class Elem, class Tr = char_traits<Elem>>  
class basic_filebuf : public basic_streambuf<Elem, Tr>  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Elem`  
 The basic element of the file buffer.  
  
 `Tr`  
 The traits of the basic element of the file buffer (usually `char_traits`< `Elem`>).  
  
## Remarks  
 The template class describes a stream buffer that controls the transmission of elements of type `Elem`, whose character traits are determined by the class `Tr`, to and from a sequence of elements stored in an external file.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Objects of type `basic_filebuf` are created with an internal buffer of type `char *` regardless of the `char_type` specified by the type parameter `Elem`. This means that a Unicode string (containing `wchar_t` characters) will be converted to an ANSI string (containing `char` characters) before it is written to the internal buffer. To store Unicode strings in the buffer, create a new buffer of type `wchar_t` and set it using the [basic_streambuf::pubsetbuf](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#basic_streambuf__pubsetbuf)`()` method. To see an example that demonstrates this behavior, see below.  
  
 An object of class `basic_filebuf`< `Elem`, `Tr`> stores a file pointer, which designates the `FILE` object that controls the stream associated with an open file. It also stores pointers to two file conversion facets for use by the protected member functions [overflow](#basic_filebuf__overflow) and [underflow](#basic_filebuf__underflow). For more information, see [basic_filebuf::open](#basic_filebuf__open).  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates how to force an object of type `basic_filebuf<wchar_t>` to store Unicode characters in its internal buffer by calling the `pubsetbuf()` method.  
  
```  
// unicode_basic_filebuf.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
  
#include <iostream>  
#include <string>  
#include <fstream>  
#include <iomanip>  
#include <memory.h>  
#include <string.h>  
  
#define IBUFSIZE 16  
  
using namespace std;  
  
void hexdump(const string& filename);  
  
int main()  
{  
    wchar_t* wszHello = L"Hello World";  
    wchar_t wBuffer[128];  
  
    basic_filebuf<wchar_t> wOutFile;  
  
    // Open a file, wcHello.txt, then write to it, then dump the  
    // file's contents in hex  
    wOutFile.open("wcHello.txt",  
        ios_base::out | ios_base::trunc | ios_base::binary);  
    if(!wOutFile.is_open())  
    {  
        cout << "Error Opening wcHello.txt\n";  
        return -1;  
    }  
    wOutFile.sputn(wszHello, (streamsize)wcslen(wszHello));  
    wOutFile.close();  
    cout << "Hex Dump of wcHello.txt - note that output is ANSI chars:\n";  
    hexdump(string("wcHello.txt"));  
  
    // Open a file, wwHello.txt, then set the internal buffer of  
    // the basic_filebuf object to be of type wchar_t, then write  
    // to the file and dump the file's contents in hex  
    wOutFile.open("wwHello.txt",  
        ios_base::out | ios_base::trunc | ios_base::binary);  
    if(!wOutFile.is_open())  
    {  
        cout << "Error Opening wwHello.txt\n";  
        return -1;  
    }  
    wOutFile.pubsetbuf(wBuffer, (streamsize)128);  
    wOutFile.sputn(wszHello, (streamsize)wcslen(wszHello));  
    wOutFile.close();  
    cout << "\nHex Dump of wwHello.txt - note that output is wchar_t chars:\n";  
    hexdump(string("wwHello.txt"));  
  
    return 0;  
}  
  
// dump contents of filename to stdout in hex  
void hexdump(const string& filename)  
{  
    fstream ifile(filename.c_str(),  
        ios_base::in | ios_base::binary);  
    char *ibuff = new char[IBUFSIZE];  
    char *obuff = new char[(IBUFSIZE*2)+1];  
    int i;  
  
    if(!ifile.is_open())  
    {  
        cout << "Cannot Open " << filename.c_str()  
             << " for reading\n";  
        return;  
    }  
    if(!ibuff || !obuff)  
    {  
        cout << "Cannot Allocate buffers\n";  
        ifile.close();  
        return;  
    }  
  
    while(!ifile.eof())  
    {  
        memset(obuff,0,(IBUFSIZE*2)+1);  
        memset(ibuff,0,IBUFSIZE);  
        ifile.read(ibuff,IBUFSIZE);  
  
        // corner case where file is exactly a multiple of  
        // 16 bytes in length  
        if(ibuff[0] == 0 && ifile.eof())  
            break;  
  
        for(i = 0; i < IBUFSIZE; i++)  
        {  
            if(ibuff[i] >= ' ')  
                obuff[i] = ibuff[i];  
            else  
                obuff[i] = '.';  
  
            cout << setfill('0') << setw(2) << hex  
                 << (int)ibuff[i] << ' ';  
        }  
        cout << "  " << obuff << endl;  
    }  
    ifile.close();  
}  
```  
  
```Output

## Requirements  
 **Header:** \<fstream>  
  
 **Namespace:** std  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__basic_filebuf"></a>  basic_filebuf::basic_filebuf  
 Constructs an object of type `basic_filebuf`.  
  
```  
basic_filebuf();

basic_filebuf(basic_filebuf&& right);
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The first constructor stores a null pointer in all the pointers controlling the input buffer and the output buffer. It also stores a null pointer in the file pointer.  
  
 The second constructor initializes the object with the contents of `right`, treated as an rvalue reference.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__char_type"></a>  basic_filebuf::char_type  
 Associates a type name with the **Elem** template parameter.  
  
```  
typedef Elem char_type;  
```  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__close"></a>  basic_filebuf::close  
 Closes a file.  
  
```  
basic_filebuf<Elem, Tr> *close();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The member function returns a null pointer if the file pointer is a null pointer.  
  
### Remarks  
 **close** calls `fclose`( **fp**). If that function returns a nonzero value, the function returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns **this** to indicate that the file was successfully closed.  
  
 For a wide stream, if any insertions have occurred since the stream was opened, or since the last call to `streampos`, the function calls [overflow](#basic_filebuf__overflow). It also inserts any sequence needed to restore the initial conversion state, by using the file conversion facet **fac** to call **fac.unshift** as needed. Each element **byte** of type `char` thus produced is written to the associated stream designated by the file pointer **fp** as if by successive calls of the form `fputc`( **byte**, **fp**). If the call to **fac.unshift** or any write fails, the function does not succeed.  
  
### Example  
  The following sample assumes two files in the current directory: basic_filebuf_close.txt (contents is "testing") and iotest.txt (contents is "ssss").  
  
```  
// basic_filebuf_close.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <fstream>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main() {  
   using namespace std;  
   ifstream file;  
   basic_ifstream <wchar_t> wfile;  
   char c;  
   // Open and close with a basic_filebuf  
   file.rdbuf()->open( "basic_filebuf_close.txt", ios::in );  
   file >> c;  
   cout << c << endl;  
   file.rdbuf( )->close( );  
  
   // Open/close directly  
   file.open( "iotest.txt" );  
   file >> c;  
   cout << c << endl;  
   file.close( );  
  
   // open a file with a wide character name  
   wfile.open( L"iotest.txt" );  
  
   // Open and close a nonexistent with a basic_filebuf  
   file.rdbuf()->open( "ziotest.txt", ios::in );  
   cout << file.fail() << endl;  
   file.rdbuf( )->close( );  
  
   // Open/close directly  
   file.open( "ziotest.txt" );  
   cout << file.fail() << endl;  
   file.close( );  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
t  
s  
0  
1  
```  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__int_type"></a>  basic_filebuf::int_type  
 Makes this type within basic_filebuf's scope equivalent to the type of the same name in the **Tr** scope.  
  
```  
typedef typename traits_type::int_type int_type;  
```  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__is_open"></a>  basic_filebuf::is_open  
 Indicates whether a file is open.  
  
```  
bool is_open() const;
```  
  
### Return Value  
 **true** if the file pointer is not a null pointer.  
  
### Example  
  
```cpp  
// basic_filebuf_is_open.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <fstream>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;  
   ifstream file;  
   cout << boolalpha << file.rdbuf( )->is_open( ) << endl;  
  
   file.open( "basic_filebuf_is_open.cpp" );  
   cout << file.rdbuf( )->is_open( ) << endl;  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
false  
true  
```  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__off_type"></a>  basic_filebuf::off_type  
 Makes this type within basic_filebuf's scope equivalent to the type of the same name in the **Tr** scope.  
  
```  
typedef typename traits_type::off_type off_type;  
```  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__open"></a>  basic_filebuf::open  
 Opens a file.  
  
```  
basic_filebuf<Elem, Tr> *open(
    const char* _Filename,  
    ios_base::openmode _Mode,  
    int _Prot = (int)ios_base::_Openprot);

basic_filebuf<Elem, Tr> *open(
    const char* _Filename,  
    ios_base::openmode _Mode);

basic_filebuf<Elem, Tr> *open(
    const wchar_t* _Filename,  
    ios_base::openmode _Mode,  
    int _Prot = (int)ios_base::_Openprot);

basic_filebuf<Elem, Tr> *open(
    const wchar_t* _Filename,  
    ios_base::openmode _Mode);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Filename`  
 The name of the file to open.  
  
 `_Mode`  
 One of the enumerations in [ios_base::openmode](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#ios_base__openmode).  
  
 `_Prot`  
 The default file opening protection, equivalent to the `shflag` parameter in [_fsopen, _wfsopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fsopen-wfsopen.md).  
  
### Return Value  
 If the file pointer is a null pointer, the function returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns **this**.  
  
### Remarks  
 The member function opens the file with filename *filename*, by calling [fopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen.md)( *filename*, **strmode**). **strmode** is determined from **mode &**~( [ate](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#ios_base__openmode) & &#124; [binary](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#ios_base__openmode)):  
  
- **ios_base::in** becomes **"r"** (open existing file for reading).  
  
- [ios_base::out](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#ios_base__fmtflags) or **ios_base::out &#124; ios_base::trunc** becomes **"w"** (truncate existing file or create for writing).  
  
- **ios_base::out &#124; app** becomes **"a"** (open existing file for appending all writes).  
  
- **ios_base::in &#124; ios_base::out** becomes **"r+"** (open existing file for reading and writing).  
  
- **ios_base::in &#124; ios_base::out &#124; ios_base::trunc** becomes **"w+"** (truncate existing file or create for reading and writing).  
  
- **ios_base::in &#124; ios_base::out &#124; ios_base::app** becomes **"a+"** (open existing file for reading and for appending all writes).  
  
 If **mode & ios_base::binary** is nonzero, the function appends **b** to **strmode** to open a binary stream instead of a text stream. It then stores the value returned by `fopen` in the file pointer **fp**. If **mode & ios_base::ate** is nonzero and the file pointer is not a null pointer, the function calls `fseek`( **fp**, 0, `SEEK_END`) to position the stream at end of file. If that positioning operation fails, the function calls [close](#basic_filebuf__close)( **fp**) and stores a null pointer in the file pointer.  
  
 If the file pointer is not a null pointer, the function determines the file conversion facet: `use_facet`< `codecvt`< **Elem**, `char`, **traits_type::**[state_type](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__state_type)> >( [getloc](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#basic_streambuf__getloc)), for use by [underflow](#basic_filebuf__underflow) and [overflow](#basic_filebuf__overflow).  
  
 If the file pointer is a null pointer, the function returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns **this**.  
  
### Example  
  See [basic_filebuf::close](#basic_filebuf__close) for an example that uses **open**.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__operator_eq"></a>  basic_filebuf::operator=  
 Assign the content of this stream buffer object. This is a move assignment involving an rvalue that does not leave a copy behind.  
  
```  
basic_filebuf& operator=(basic_filebuf&& right);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 ` right`  
 An rvalue reference to a [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md) object.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns *this.  
  
### Remarks  
 The member operator replaces the contents of the object by using the contents of ` right`, treated as an rvalue reference. For more information, see [Rvalue Reference Declarator: &&](../cpp/rvalue-reference-declarator-amp-amp.md).  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__overflow"></a>  basic_filebuf::overflow  
 Called when a new character is inserted into a full buffer.  
  
```  
virtual int_type overflow(int_type _Meta = traits_type::eof);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Meta`  
 The character to insert into the buffer or **traits_type::eof**.  
  
### Return Value  
 If the function cannot succeed, it returns **traits_type::eof**. Otherwise, it returns **traits_type::**[not_eof](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__not_eof)(_ *Meta*).  
  
### Remarks  
 If _ *Meta***!= traits_type::**[eof](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__eof), the protected virtual member function endeavors to insert the element **ch = traits_type::**[to_char_type](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__to_char_type)(\_ *Meta*) into the output buffer. It can do so in various ways:  
  
-   If a write position is available, it can store the element into the write position and increment the next pointer for the output buffer.  
  
-   It can make a write position available by allocating new or additional storage for the output buffer.  
  
-   It can convert any pending output in the output buffer, followed by **ch**, by using the file conversion facet **fac** to call **fac.out** as needed. Each element `ch` of type *char* thus produced is written to the associated stream designated by the file pointer **fp** as if by successive calls of the form `fputc`( **ch**, **fp**). If any conversion or write fails, the function does not succeed.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__pbackfail"></a>  basic_filebuf::pbackfail  
 Tries to put back an element into the input stream, then make it the current element (pointed to by the next pointer).  
  
```  
virtual int_type pbackfail(int_type _Meta = traits_type::eof);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Meta`  
 The character to insert into the buffer, or **traits_type::eof**.  
  
### Return Value  
 If the function cannot succeed, it returns **traits_type::eof**. Otherwise, it returns **traits_type::**[not_eof](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__not_eof)(_ *Meta*).  
  
### Remarks  
 The protected virtual member function puts back an element into the input buffer and then makes it the current element (pointed to by the next pointer). If _ *Meta* **== traits_type::**[eof](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__eof), the element to push back is effectively the one already in the stream before the current element. Otherwise, that element is replaced by **ch = traits_type::**[to_char_type](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__to_char_type)(\_ *Meta*). The function can put back an element in various ways:  
  
-   If a putback position is available, and the element stored there compares equal to **ch**, it can decrement the next pointer for the input buffer.  
  
-   If the function can make a `putback` position available, it can do so, set the next pointer to point at that position, and store **ch** in that position.  
  
-   If the function can push back an element onto the input stream, it can do so, such as by calling `ungetc` for an element of type `char`*.*  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__pos_type"></a>  basic_filebuf::pos_type  
 Makes this type within basic_filebuf's scope equivalent to the type of the same name in the **Tr** scope.  
  
```  
typedef typename traits_type::pos_type pos_type;  
```  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__seekoff"></a>  basic_filebuf::seekoff  
 Tries to alter the current positions for the controlled streams.  
  
```  
virtual pos_type seekoff(off_type _Off,
    ios_base::seekdir _Way,
    ios_base::openmode _Which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Off`  
 The position to seek for relative to `_Way`.  
  
 `_Way`  
 The starting point for offset operations. See [seekdir](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#ios_base__seekdir) for possible values.  
  
 `_Which`  
 Specifies the mode for the pointer position. The default is to allow you to modify the read and write positions.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the new position or an invalid stream position.  
  
### Remarks  
 The protected virtual member function endeavors to alter the current positions for the controlled streams. For an object of class [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)< `Elem`, `Tr`>, a stream position can be represented by an object of type `fpos_t`, which stores an offset and any state information needed to parse a wide stream. Offset zero designates the first element of the stream. (An object of type [pos_type](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#basic_streambuf__pos_type) stores at least an `fpos_t` object.)  
  
 For a file opened for both reading and writing, both the input and output streams are positioned in tandem. To switch between inserting and extracting, you must call either [pubseekoff](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#basic_streambuf__pubseekoff) or [pubseekpos](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#basic_streambuf__pubseekpos). Calls to `pubseekoff` (and hence to `seekoff`) have various limitations for [text streams](../c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-streams.md), [binary streams](../c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-streams.md), and [wide streams](../c-runtime-library/byte-and-wide-streams.md).  
  
 If the file pointer **fp** is a null pointer, the function fails. Otherwise, it endeavors to alter the stream position by calling `fseek`( **fp**, `_Off`, `_Way`). If that function succeeds and the resulting position **fposn** can be determined by calling `fgetpos`( **fp**, **&fposn**), the function succeeds. If the function succeeds, it returns a value of type **pos_type** containing **fposn**. Otherwise, it returns an invalid stream position.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__seekpos"></a>  basic_filebuf::seekpos  
 Tries to alter the current positions for the controlled streams.  
  
```  
virtual pos_type seekpos(pos_type _Sp, ios_base::openmode _Which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Sp`  
 The position to seek for.  
  
 `_Which`  
 Specifies the mode for the pointer position. The default is to allow you to modify the read and write positions.  
  
### Return Value  
 If the file pointer **fp** is a null pointer, the function fails. Otherwise, it endeavors to alter the stream position by calling `fsetpos`( **fp**, **&fposn**), where **fposn** is the `fpos_t` object stored in `pos`. If that function succeeds, the function returns `pos`. Otherwise, it returns an invalid stream position. To determine if the stream position is invalid, compare the return value with `pos_type(off_type(-1))`.  
  
### Remarks  
 The protected virtual member function endeavors to alter the current positions for the controlled streams. For an object of class [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)\< **Elem**, **Tr**>, a stream position can be represented by an object of type `fpos_t`, which stores an offset and any state information needed to parse a wide stream. Offset zero designates the first element of the stream. (An object of type `pos_type` stores at least an `fpos_t` object.)  
  
 For a file opened for both reading and writing, both the input and output streams are positioned in tandem. To switch between inserting and extracting, you must call either [pubseekoff](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#basic_streambuf__pubseekoff) or [pubseekpos](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md#basic_streambuf__pubseekpos). Calls to `pubseekoff` (and hence to `seekoff`) have various limitations for text streams, binary streams, and wide streams.  
  
 For a wide stream, if any insertions have occurred since the stream was opened, or since the last call to `streampos`, the function calls [overflow](#basic_filebuf__overflow). It also inserts any sequence needed to restore the initial conversion state, by using the file conversion facet **fac** to call **fac**`.``unshift` as needed. Each element **byte** of type `char` thus produced is written to the associated stream designated by the file pointer **fp** as if by successive calls of the form `fputc`( **byte**, **fp**). If the call to **fac.unshift** or any write fails, the function does not succeed.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__setbuf"></a>  basic_filebuf::setbuf  
 Performs an operation particular to each derived stream buffer.  
  
```  
virtual basic_streambuf<Elem, Tr> *setbuf(
    char_type* _Buffer,  
    streamsize count);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Buffer`  
 Pointer to a buffer.  
  
 ` count`  
 Size of the buffer.  
  
### Return Value  
 The protected member function returns zero if the file pointer `fp` is a null pointer.  
  
### Remarks  
 `setbuf` calls `setvbuf`( **fp**, ( `char` \*) `_Buffer`, `_IOFBF`, ` count` \* `sizeof` ( **Elem**) ) to offer the array of ` count` elements beginning at _ *Buffer* as a buffer for the stream. If that function returns a nonzero value, the function returns a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns **this** to signal success.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__swap"></a>  basic_filebuf::swap  
 Exchanges the contents of this `basic_filebuf` for the contents of the provided `basic_filebuf`.  
  
```  
void swap(basic_filebuf& right);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 ` right`  
 An `lvalue` reference to another `basic_filebuf`.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__sync"></a>  basic_filebuf::sync  
 Tries to synchronize the controlled streams with any associated external streams.  
  
```  
virtual int sync();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns zero if the file pointer **fp** is a null pointer. Otherwise, it returns zero only if calls to both [overflow](#basic_filebuf__overflow) and `fflush`( **fp**) succeed in flushing any pending output to the stream.  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__traits_type"></a>  basic_filebuf::traits_type  
 Associates a type name with the **Tr** template parameter.  
  
```  
typedef Tr traits_type;  
```  
  
##  <a name="basic_filebuf__underflow"></a>  basic_filebuf::underflow  
 Extracts the current element from the input stream.  
  
```  
virtual int_type underflow();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 If the function cannot succeed, it returns **traits_type::**[eof](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__eof). Otherwise, it returns **ch**, converted as described in the Remarks section.  
  
### Remarks  
 The protected virtual member function endeavors to extract the current element **ch** from the input stream, and return the element as **traits_type::**[to_int_type](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__to_int_type)( **ch**). It can do so in various ways:  
  
-   If a read position is available, it takes **ch** as the element stored in the read position and advances the next pointer for the input buffer.  
  
-   It can read one or more elements of type `char`*,* as if by successive calls of the form `fgetc`( **fp**), and convert them to an element **ch** of type **Elem** by using the file conversion facet fac to call **fac.in** as needed. If any read or conversion fails, the function does not succeed.
