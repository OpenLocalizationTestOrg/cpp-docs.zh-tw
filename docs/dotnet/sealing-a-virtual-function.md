# Sealing a Virtual Function
The syntax for sealing a virtual function has changed from Managed Extensions for C++ to [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_long](../dotnet/includes/cpp_current_long_md.md)].  
  
 The `__sealed` keyword is used in Managed Extensions to modify either a reference type, disallowing subsequent derivation from it (see [Declaration of a Managed Class Type](../dotnet/declaration-of-a-managed-class-type.md)), or to modify a virtual function, disallowing subsequent overriding of the method in a derived class. For example:  
  
```  
__gc class base { public: virtual void f(); };  
__gc class derived : public base {  
public:  
   __sealed void f();  
};  
```  
  
 In this example, `derived::f()` overrides the `base::f()` instance based on the exact match of the function prototype. The `__sealed` keyword indicates that a subsequent class inherited from the derived class cannot provide an override of `derived::f()`.  
  
 In the new syntax, `sealed` is placed after the signature rather than being allowed to appear anywhere before the actual function prototype, as was previously allowed. In addition, the use of `sealed` requires an explicit use of the `virtual` keyword as well. That is, the correct translation of `derived`, above, is as follows:  
  
```  
ref class derived: public base {  
public:  
   virtual void f() override sealed;  
};  
```  
  
 The absence of the `virtual` keyword in this instance results in an error. In the new syntax, the contextual keyword `abstract` can be used in place of the `=0` to indicate a pure virtual function. This was not supported within Managed Extensions. For example:  
  
```  
__gc class base { public: virtual void f()=0; };  
```  
  
 can be rewritten as  
  
```  
ref class base { public: virtual void f() abstract; };  
```
