# list::merge (STL/CLR)
Merges two ordered controlled sequences.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void merge(list<Value>% right);  
template<typename Pred2>  
    void merge(list<Value>% right, Pred2 pred);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 pred  
 Comparer for element pairs.  
  
 right  
 Container to merge in.  
  
## Remarks  
 The first member function removes all elements from the sequence controlled by `right` and insert them in the controlled sequence. Both sequences must be previously ordered by `operator<` -- elements must not decrease in value as you progress through either sequence. The resulting sequence is also ordered by `operator<`. You use this member function to merge two sequences that increase in value into a sequence that also increases in value.  
  
 The second member function behaves the same as the first, except that the sequences are ordered by `pred` -- `pred``(X, Y)` must be false for any element `X` that follows element `Y` in the sequence. You use it to merge two sequences ordered by a predicate function or delegate that you specify.  
  
 Both functions perform a stable merge -- no pair of elements in either of the original controlled sequences is reversed in the resulting controlled sequence. Also, if a pair of elements `X` and `Y` in the resulting controlled sequence has equivalent ordering -- `!(X < Y) && !(X < Y)` -- an element from the original controlled sequence appears before an element from the sequence controlled by `right`.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// cliext_list_merge.cpp   
// compile with: /clr   
#include <cliext/list>   
  
typedef cliext::list<wchar_t> Mylist;   
int main()   
    {   
    cliext::list<wchar_t> c1;   
    c1.push_back(L'a');   
    c1.push_back(L'c');   
    c1.push_back(L'e');   
  
// display initial contents " a c e"   
    for each (wchar_t elem in c1)   
        System::Console::Write(" {0}", elem);   
    System::Console::WriteLine();   
  
    cliext::list<wchar_t> c2;   
    c2.push_back(L'b');   
    c2.push_back(L'd');   
    c2.push_back(L'f');   
  
// display initial contents " b d f"   
    for each (wchar_t elem in c2)   
        System::Console::Write(" {0}", elem);   
    System::Console::WriteLine();   
  
// merge and display   
    cliext::list<wchar_t> c3(c1);   
    c3.merge(c2);   
    for each (wchar_t elem in c3)   
        System::Console::Write(" {0}", elem);   
    System::Console::WriteLine();   
    System::Console::WriteLine("c2.size() = {0}", c2.size());   
  
// sort descending, merge descending, and redisplay   
    c1.sort(cliext::greater<wchar_t>());   
    for each (wchar_t elem in c1)   
        System::Console::Write(" {0}", elem);   
    System::Console::WriteLine();   
  
    c3.sort(cliext::greater<wchar_t>());   
    for each (wchar_t elem in c3)   
        System::Console::Write(" {0}", elem);   
    System::Console::WriteLine();   
  
    c3.merge(c1, cliext::greater<wchar_t>());   
    for each (wchar_t elem in c3)   
        System::Console::Write(" {0}", elem);   
    System::Console::WriteLine();   
    System::Console::WriteLine("c1.size() = {0}", c1.size());   
    return (0);   
    }  
  
```  
  
```Output  
 a c e  
 b d f  
 a b c d e f  
c2.size() = 0  
 e c a  
 f e d c b a  
 f e e d c c b a a  
c1.size() = 0  
```
