# Value Types and Their Behaviors (C++/CLI)
Value types have changed in various ways from Managed Extensions for C++ to [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_long](../dotnet/includes/cpp_current_long_md.md)]. In this section, we look at the CLR enum type and the value class type, together with a look at boxing and access to the boxed instance on the CLR heap, as well as a look at interior and pinning pointers. There have been extensive language changes in this area.  
  
## In This Section  
 [CLR Enum Type](../dotnet/value-types-and-their-behaviors-cpp-cli.md)  
 Discusses changes in the declaration and behavior of enums.  
  
 [Implicit Boxing of Value Types](../dotnet/implicit-boxing-of-value-types.md)  
 Discusses the motivation for implicit boxing of value types and the consequent changes in behavior.  
  
 [A Tracking Handle to a Boxed Value](../dotnet/a-tracking-handle-to-a-boxed-value.md)  
 Discusses how implicit boxing of value types translates to a tracking handle to the boxed value object.  
  
 [Value Type Semantics](../dotnet/value-type-semantics.md)  
 Discusses changes to value type semantics, including inherited virtual methods, class default constructors, interior pointers, and pinning pointers.
