# Static Const Int Linkage Is No Longer Literal
Declaration of a constant member of a class has changed from Managed Extensions for C++ to [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_long](../dotnet/includes/cpp_current_long_md.md)].  
  
 Although `static const` integral members are still supported, their linkage attribute has changed. Their former linkage attribute is now carried in a literal integral member. For example, consider the following Managed Extensions class:  
  
```  
public __gc class Constants {  
public:  
   static const int LOG_DEBUG = 4;  
};  
```  
  
 This generates the following underlying CIL attributes for the field (note the literal attribute):  
  
```  
.field public static literal int32   
modopt([Microsoft.VisualC]Microsoft.VisualC.IsConstModifier) STANDARD_CLIENT_PRX = int32(0x00000004)  
```  
  
 While this still compiles under the new syntax:  
  
```  
public ref class Constants {  
public:  
   static const int LOG_DEBUG = 4;  
};  
```  
  
 it no longer emits the literal attribute, and therefore is not viewed as a constant by the CLR runtime:  
  
```  
.field public static int32 modopt([Microsoft.VisualC]Microsoft.VisualC.IsConstModifier) STANDARD_CLIENT_PRX = int32(0x00000004)  
```  
  
 In order to have the same inter-language literal attribute, the declaration should be changed to the newly supported `literal` data member, as follows,  
  
```  
public ref class Constants {  
public:  
   literal int LOG_DEBUG = 4;  
};  
```
