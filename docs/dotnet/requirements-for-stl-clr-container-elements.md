# Requirements for STL/CLR Container Elements
All reference types that are inserted into STL/CLR containers must have, at a minimum, the following elements:  
  
-   A public copy constructor.  
  
-   A public assignment operator.  
  
-   A public destructor.  
  
 Furthermore, associative containers such as [set](../dotnet/set-stl-clr.md) and [map](../dotnet/map-stl-clr.md) must have a public comparison operator defined, which is `operator<` by default. Some operations on containers might also require a public default constructor and a public equivalence operator to be defined.  
  
 Like reference types, value types and handles to reference types that are to be inserted into an associative container must have a comparison operator such as `operator<` defined. The requirements for a public copy constructor, public assignment operator, and a public destructor do not exist for value types or handles to reference types.
