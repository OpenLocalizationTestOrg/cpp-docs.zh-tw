# ATL/MFC Shared Classes
Beginning with Visual C++ .NET 2002, several existing MFC utility classes were rewritten or revised to reduce their dependencies on other MFC classes. These utility classes can now be used in any native C++ project. This section only includes classes that were previously available to MFC projects and have now been shared, plus a few new classes related to the changes in `CString`. It does not include the ATL classes, which can be used in any native C++ project type by inclusion of the appropriate header.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Classes Shared Between MFC and ATL](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/classes-shared-by-mfc-and-atl.md)  
 Provides links to the classes shared between MFC and ATL.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Active Template Library (ATL) Reference](../atl/atl-com-desktop-components.md)  
 Provides reference material for the ATL Library, a set of template-based C++ classes that simplify the programming of COM objects.  
  
 [Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) Reference](../mfc/mfc-desktop-applications.md)  
 Provides reference material for the MFC Library, a set of classes in that constitute an application framework, which is the framework of an application written for the Windows API.
