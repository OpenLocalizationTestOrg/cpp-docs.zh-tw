# Date and Time
MFC supports several different ways of working with dates and times. These include:  
  
-   General-purpose time classes. The [CTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctime-class.md) and [CTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctimespan-class.md) classes encapsulate most of the functionality associated with the ANSI-standard time library, which is declared in TIME.H.  
  
-   Support for system clock. With MFC version 3.0, support was added to `CTime` for the Win32 `SYSTEMTIME` and `FILETIME` data types.  
  
-   Support for the Automation [DATE data type](../atl-mfc-shared/date-type.md). **DATE** supports date, time, and date/time values. The [COleDateTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md) and [COleDateTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetimespan-class.md) classes encapsulate this functionality. They work with the [COleVariant](../mfc/reference/colevariant-class.md) class using Automation support.
