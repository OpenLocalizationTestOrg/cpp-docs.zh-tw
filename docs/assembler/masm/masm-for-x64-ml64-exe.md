# MASM for x64 (ml64.exe)
ml64.exe is the assembler that accepts [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)] assembly language. For information on ml64.exe compiler options, see [ML and ML64 Command-Line Reference](../../assembler/masm/ml-and-ml64-command-line-reference.md).  
  
 Inline ASM is not supported for [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)]. Use MASM or compiler intrinsics ([x64 Intrinsics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/5d1f5d3e-156e-4ebf-932e-fd09be7ced62)).  
  
 The two workarounds are separate assembly with MASM (which supports x64 fully) and compiler intrinsics. We’ve added a lot of intrinsics to allow customers to make use of special-function instructions (e.g. privileged, bit scan/test, interlocked, etc…) in as close to cross-platform a manner as possible.  
  
## ml64-Specific Directives  
 Use the following directives with ml64.exe:  
  
-   [.ALLOCSTACK](../../assembler/masm/dot-allocstack.md)  
  
-   [.ENDPROLOG](../../assembler/masm/dot-endprolog.md)  
  
-   [.PUSHFRAME](../../assembler/masm/dot-pushframe.md)  
  
-   [.PUSHREG](../../assembler/masm/dot-pushreg.md)  
  
-   [.SAVEREG](../../assembler/masm/dot-savereg.md)  
  
-   [.SAVEXMM128](../../assembler/masm/dot-savexmm128.md)  
  
-   [.SETFRAME](../../assembler/masm/dot-setframe.md)  
  
 In addition, the [PROC](../../assembler/masm/proc.md) directive was updated for use with ml64.exe.  
  
## 32-Bit Address Mode (Address Size Override)  
 MASM will emit the 0x67 address size override if a memory operand includes 32-bit registers. For example, the following examples cause the address size override to be emitted:  
  
```  
mov rax, QWORD PTR [ecx]  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx*2+r10d]  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx*2+r10d+0100h]  
prefetch [eax]  
movnti rax, QWORD PTR [r8d]  
```  
  
 MASM assumes that if a 32-bit displacement appears alone as a memory operand, 64-bit addressing is intended. There is currently no support for 32-bit addressing with such operands.  
  
 Finally, mixing register sizes within a memory operand, as demonstrated in the following code, will generate an error.  
  
```  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [rcx*2+r10d]  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx*2+r10+0100h]  
```
