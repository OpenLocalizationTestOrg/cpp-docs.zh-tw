# Using Operators in __asm Blocks
## Microsoft Specific  
 An `__asm` block cannot use C or C++ specific operators, such as the **<<** operator. However, operators shared by C and MASM, such as the \* operator, are interpreted as assembly-language operators. For instance, outside an `__asm` block, square brackets (**[ ]**) are interpreted as enclosing array subscripts, which C automatically scales to the size of an element in the array. Inside an `__asm` block, they are seen as the MASM index operator, which yields an unscaled byte offset from any data object or label (not just an array). The following code illustrates the difference:  
  
```  
int array[10];  
  
__asm mov array[6], bx ;  Store BX at array+6 (not scaled)  
  
array[6] = 0;         /* Store 0 at array+24 (scaled) */  
```  
  
 The first reference to `array` is not scaled, but the second is. Note that you can use the **TYPE** operator to achieve scaling based on a constant. For example, the following statements are equivalent:  
  
```  
__asm mov array[6 * TYPE int], 0 ; Store 0 at array + 24  
  
array[6] = 0;                   /* Store 0 at array + 24 */  
```  
  
 **END Microsoft Specific**
