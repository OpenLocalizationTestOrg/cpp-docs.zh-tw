# Jumping to Labels in Inline Assembly
## Microsoft Specific  
 Like an ordinary C or C++ label, a label in an `__asm` block has scope throughout the function in which it is defined (not only in the block). Both assembly instructions and `goto` statements can jump to labels inside or outside the `__asm` block.  
  
 Labels defined in `__asm` blocks are not case sensitive; both `goto` statements and assembly instructions can refer to those labels without regard to case. C and C++ labels are case sensitive only when used by `goto` statements. Assembly instructions can jump to a C or C++ label without regard to case.  
  
 The following code shows all the permutations:  
  
```  
void func( void )  
{  
   goto C_Dest;  /* Legal: correct case   */  
   goto c_dest;  /* Error: incorrect case */  
  
   goto A_Dest;  /* Legal: correct case   */  
   goto a_dest;  /* Legal: incorrect case */  
  
   __asm  
   {  
      jmp C_Dest ; Legal: correct case  
      jmp c_dest ; Legal: incorrect case  
  
      jmp A_Dest ; Legal: correct case  
      jmp a_dest ; Legal: incorrect case  
  
      a_dest:    ; __asm label  
   }  
  
   C_Dest:       /* C label */   
   return;  
}  
int main()  
{  
}  
```  
  
 Don't use C library function names as labels in `__asm` blocks. For instance, you might be tempted to use `exit` as a label, as follows:  
  
```  
; BAD TECHNIQUE: using library function name as label  
jne exit  
   .  
   .  
   .  
exit:  
   ; More __asm code follows  
```  
  
 Because **exit** is the name of a C library function, this code might cause a jump to the **exit** function instead of to the desired location.  
  
 As in MASM programs, the dollar symbol (`$`) serves as the current location counter. It is a label for the instruction currently being assembled. In `__asm` blocks, its main use is to make long conditional jumps:  
  
```  
jne $+5 ; next instruction is 5 bytes long  
jmp farlabel  
; $+5  
   .  
   .  
   .  
farlabel:  
```
