# Accessing C or C++ Data in __asm Blocks
## Microsoft Specific  
 A great convenience of inline assembly is the ability to refer to C or C++ variables by name. An `__asm` block can refer to any symbols, including variable names, that are in scope where the block appears. For instance, if the C variable `var` is in scope, the instruction  
  
```  
__asm mov eax, var  
```  
  
 stores the value of `var` in EAX.  
  
 If a class, structure, or union member has a unique name, an `__asm` block can refer to it using only the member name, without specifying the variable or `typedef` name before the period (**.**) operator. If the member name is not unique, however, you must place a variable or `typedef` name immediately before the period operator. For example, the structure types in the following sample share `same_name` as their member name:.  
  
 If you declare variables with the types  
  
```  
struct first_type hal;  
struct second_type oat;  
```  
  
 all references to the member `same_name` must use the variable name because `same_name` is not unique. But the member `weasel` has a unique name, so you can refer to it using only its member name:  
  
```  
// InlineAssembler_Accessing_C_asm_Blocks.cpp  
// processor: x86  
#include <stdio.h>  
struct first_type  
{  
   char *weasel;  
   int same_name;  
};  
  
struct second_type  
{  
   int wonton;  
   long same_name;  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
   struct first_type hal;  
   struct second_type oat;  
  
   __asm  
   {  
      lea ebx, hal  
      mov ecx, [ebx]hal.same_name ; Must use 'hal'  
      mov esi, [ebx].weasel       ; Can omit 'hal'  
   }  
   return 0;  
}  
```  
  
 Note that omitting the variable name is merely a coding convenience. The same assembly instructions are generated whether or not the variable name is present.  
  
 You can access data members in C++ without regard to access restrictions. However, you cannot call member functions.
