# Using C or C++ in __asm Blocks
## Microsoft Specific  
 Because inline assembly instructions can be mixed with C or C++ statements, they can refer to C or C++ variables by name and use many other elements of those languages.  
  
 An `__asm` block can use the following language elements:  
  
-   Symbols, including labels and variable and function names  
  
-   Constants, including symbolic constants and `enum` members  
  
-   Macros and preprocessor directives  
  
-   Comments (both **/\* \*/** and **//** )  
  
-   Type names (wherever a MASM type would be legal)  
  
-   `typedef` names, generally used with operators such as **PTR** and **TYPE** or to specify structure or union members  
  
 Within an `__asm` block, you can specify integer constants with either C notation or assembler radix notation (0x100 and 100h are equivalent, for example). This allows you to define (using `#define`) a constant in C and then use it in both C or C++ and assembly portions of the program. You can also specify constants in octal by preceding them with a 0. For example, 0777 specifies an octal constant.
