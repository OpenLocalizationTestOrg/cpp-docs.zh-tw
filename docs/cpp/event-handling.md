# Event Handling
Event handling is primarily supported for COM classes (C++ classes that implement COM objects, typically using ATL classes or the [coclass](../windows/coclass.md) attribute).  For more information, see [Event Handling in COM](../cpp/event-handling-in-com.md).  
  
 Event handling is also supported for native C++ classes (C++ classes that do not implement COM objects), however, that support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  For more information, see [Event Handling in Native C++](../cpp/event-handling-in-native-cpp.md).  
  
 Event handling supports single- and multithreaded usage and protects data from simultaneous multithread access. It also allows you to derive subclasses from event source or receiver classes and support extended event sourcing/receiving in the derived class.  
  
 Visual C++ includes attributes and keywords for declaring events and event handlers. The event attributes and keywords can be used in CLR programs and in native C++ programs.
