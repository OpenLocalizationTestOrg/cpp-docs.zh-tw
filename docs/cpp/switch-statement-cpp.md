# switch Statement (C++)
Allows selection among multiple sections of code, depending on the value of an integral expression.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      switch ( expression )  
   case constant-expression : statement  
   [default  : statement]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The *expression* must be of an integral type or of a class type for which there is an unambiguous conversion to integral type. Integral promotion is performed as described in [Standard Conversions](standard-conversions.md).  
  
 The `switch` statement body consists of a series of **case** labels and an optional **default** label. No two constant expressions in **case** statements can evaluate to the same value. The **default** label can appear only once. The labeled statements are not syntactic requirements, but the `switch` statement is meaningless without them.   The default statement need not come at the end; it can appear anywhere in the body of the switch statement. A case or default label can only appear inside a switch statement.  
  
 The *constant-expression* in each **case** label is converted to the type of *expression* and compared with *expression* for equality. Control passes to the statement whose **case** *constant-expression* matches the value of *expression*. The resulting behavior is shown in the following table.  
  
### Switch Statement Behavior  
  
|Condition|Action|  
|---------------|------------|  
|Converted value matches that of the promoted controlling expression.|Control is transferred to the statement following that label.|  
|None of the constants match the constants in the **case** labels; a **default** label is present.|Control is transferred to the **default** label.|  
|None of the constants match the constants in the **case** labels; **default** label is not present.|Control is transferred to the statement after the `switch` statement.|  
  
 If a matching expression is found, control is not impeded by subsequent **case** or **default** labels. The [break](../cpp/break-statement-cpp.md) statement is used to stop execution and transfer control to the statement after the `switch` statement. Without a **break** statement, every statement from the matched **case** label to the end of the `switch`, including the **default**, is executed. For example:  
  
```  
// switch_statement1.cpp  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main() {  
   char *buffer = "Any character stream";  
   int capa, lettera, nota;  
   char c;  
   capa = lettera = nota = 0;  
  
   while ( c = *buffer++ )   // Walks buffer until NULL  
   {  
      switch ( c )  
      {  
         case 'A':  
            capa++;  
            break;  
         case 'a':  
            lettera++;  
            break;  
         default:  
            nota++;  
      }  
   }  
   printf_s( "\nUppercase a: %d\nLowercase a: %d\nTotal: %d\n",  
      capa, lettera, (capa + lettera + nota) );  
}  
```  
  
 In the above example, `capa` is incremented if `c` is an uppercase `A`. The `break` statement after `capa++` terminates execution of the `switch` statement body and control passes to the `while` loop. Without the `break` statement, `lettera` and `nota` would also be incremented. A similar purpose is served by the `break` statement for `case 'a'`. If `c` is a lowercase `a`, `lettera` is incremented and the `break` statement terminates the `switch` statement body. If `c` is not an `a` or `A`, the `default` statement is executed.  
  
 An inner block of a `switch` statement can contain definitions with initializations as long as they are reachable â€” that is, not bypassed by all possible execution paths. Names introduced using these declarations have local scope. For example:  
  
```  
// switch_statement2.cpp  
// C2360 expected  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main(int argc, char *argv[])  
{  
   switch( tolower( *argv[1] ) )  
   {  
       // Error. Unreachable declaration.  
       char szChEntered[] = "Character entered was: ";  
  
   case 'a' :  
       {  
       // Declaration of szChEntered OK. Local scope.  
       char szChEntered[] = "Character entered was: ";  
       cout << szChEntered << "a\n";  
       }  
       break;  
  
   case 'b' :  
       // Value of szChEntered undefined.  
       cout << szChEntered << "b\n";  
       break;  
  
   default:  
       // Value of szChEntered undefined.  
       cout << szChEntered << "neither a nor b\n";  
       break;  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 A `switch` statement can be nested. In such cases, **case** or **default** labels associate with the closest `switch` statement that encloses them.  
  
## Microsoft Specific  
 Microsoft C does not limit the number of case values in a `switch` statement. The number is limited only by the available memory. ANSI C requires at least 257 case labels be allowed in a `switch` statement.  
  
 The default for Microsoft C is that the Microsoft extensions are enabled. Use the [/Za](../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md) compiler option to disable these extensions.
