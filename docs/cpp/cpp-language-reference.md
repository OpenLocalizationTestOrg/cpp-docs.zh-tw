# C++ Language Reference
This reference explains the C++ programming language as implemented in Microsoft Visual C++. The organization is based on *The Annotated C++ Reference Manual* by Margaret Ellis and Bjarne Stroustrup and on the ANSI/ISO C++ International Standard (ISO/IEC FDIS 14882). Microsoft-specific implementations of C++ language features are included.  

For an overview of Modern C++ programming practices, see [Welcome Back to C++](welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp.md).
  
 See the following tables to quickly find a keyword or operator:  
  
-   [C++ Keywords](../cpp/keywords-cpp.md)  
  
-   [C++ Operators](../cpp/cpp-built-in-operators-precedence-and-associativity.md)  
  
## In This Section  

 [Lexical Conventions](../cpp/lexical-conventions.md)  
 Fundamental lexical elements of a C++ program: tokens, comments, operators, keywords, punctuators, literals. Also, file translation, operator precedence/associativity.  
  
 [Basic Concepts](../cpp/basic-concepts-cpp.md)  
 Scope, linkage, program startup and termination, storage classes, and types.  
  
 [Standard Conversions](../cpp/standard-conversions.md)  
 Type conversions between built-in, or "fundamental," types. Also, arithmetic conversions and conversions among pointer, reference, and pointer-to-member types.  
  
 [Operators, Precedence and Associativity](../cpp/cpp-built-in-operators-precedence-and-associativity.md)  
 The operators in C++.  
  
 [Expressions](../cpp/expressions-cpp.md)  
 Types of expressions, semantics of expressions, reference topics on operators, casting and casting operators, run-time type information.  
  
 [Lambda Expressions](../cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp.md)  
 A programming technique that implicitly defines a function object class and constructs a function object of that class type.  
  
 [Statements](../cpp/statements-cpp.md)  
 Expression, null, compound, selection, iteration, jump, and declaration statements.  
  
 [Declarations and Definitions](declarations-and-definitions-cpp.md)  
 Storage-class specifiers, function definitions, initializations, enumerations, class, struct, and union declarations, and typedef declarations. Also, inline functions, const keyword, namespaces.  
  
 [Declarators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8a7b9b51-92bd-4ac0-b3fe-0c4abe771838)  
 The portion of a declaration statement that names an object, type, or function. Abstract declarators, type names, initializers, function declarations and definitions, arrays, references.  
  
 [Classes, Structures, and Unions](../cpp/classes-and-structs-cpp.md)  
 Introduction to classes, structures, and unions. Also, member functions, data members, bit fields, this pointer, nested classes.  
  
 [Derived Classes](../cpp/inheritance-cpp.md)  
 Single and multiple inheritance, virtual functions, multiple base classes, abstract classes, scope rules. Also, the __super and \__interface keywords.  
  
 [Member-Access Control](../cpp/member-access-control-cpp.md)  
 Controlling access to class members: public, private, and protected keywords. Friend functions and classes.  
  
 [Special Member Functions](../misc/special-member-functions-cpp.md)  
 Special functions unique to class types: constructors, destructors, conversion functions, assignment operator, operator new and operator delete functions.  
  
 [Overloading](operator-overloading.md)  
 Overloaded operators, rules for operator overloading.  
  
 [Exception Handling](../cpp/exception-handling-in-visual-cpp.md)  
 C++ exception handling, structured exception handling (SEH), keywords used in writing exception handling statements.  
  
 [Assertion and User-Supplied Messages](../cpp/assertion-and-user-supplied-messages-cpp.md)  
 `#error` directive, the `static_assert` keyword, the `assert` macro.  
  
 [Templates](../cpp/templates-cpp.md)  
 Template specifications, function templates, class templates, typename keyword, templates vs. macros, templates and smart pointers.  
  
 [Event Handling](../cpp/event-handling.md)  
 Declaring events and event handlers.  
  
 [Microsoft-Specific Modifiers](../cpp/microsoft-specific-modifiers.md)  
 Modifiers specific to Microsoft C++. Memory addressing, calling conventions, naked functions, extended storage-class attributes (__declspec), \__w64.  
  
 [Inline Assembler](../assembler/inline/inline-assembler.md)  
 Using assembly language and C++ in __asm blocks.  
  
 [Compiler COM Support](../cpp/compiler-com-support.md)  
 A reference to Microsoft-specific classes and global functions used to support COM types.  
  
 [Microsoft Extensions](../cpp/microsoft-extensions.md)  
 Microsoft extensions to C++.  
  
 [Nonstandard Behavior](../cpp/nonstandard-behavior.md)  
 Information about nonstandard behavior of the Visual C++ compiler.  

 [Welcome Back to C++](welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp.md)
 An overview of modern C++ programming practices for writing safe, correct and efficient programs.
