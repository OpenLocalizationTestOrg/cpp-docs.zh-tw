# process
Specifies that your managed application process should have a single copy of a particular global variable, static member variable, or static local variable shared across all application domains in the process. This is primarily intended to be used when compiling with **/clr:pure**, because under **/clr:pure** global and static variables are per application domain, by default. When compiling with **/clr**, global and static variables are per process by default (do not need to use `__declspec(process)`.  
  
 Only a global variable, a static member variable, or a static local variable of native type can be marked with `__declspec(process)`.  
  
 When compiling with **/clr:pure**, variables marked as per process must also be declared as `const`. This ensures that per process variables are not changed in one application domain, and giving unexpected results in another application domain. The primary intended use of `__declspec(process)` is to enable compile time initialization of a global variable, static member variable, or static local variable under **/clr:pure**.  
  
 `process` is only valid when compiling with [/clr](../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) or **/clr:pure** and is not valid when compiling with **/clr:safe**.  
  
 If you want each application domain to have its own copy of a global variable, use [appdomain](../cpp/appdomain.md).  
  
 See [Application Domains and Visual C++](../dotnet/application-domains-and-visual-cpp.md) for more information.
