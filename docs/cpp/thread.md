# thread
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The **thread** extended storage-class modifier is used to declare a thread local variable. For the portable equivalent in C++11, use the [thread_local](../cpp/storage-classes-cpp.md#thread_local) storage class specifier.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
__declspec( thread ) declarator  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Thread Local Storage (TLS) is the mechanism by which each thread in a multithreaded process allocates storage for thread-specific data. In standard multithreaded programs, data is shared among all threads of a given process, whereas thread local storage is the mechanism for allocating per-thread data. For a complete discussion of threads, see [Multithreading](../parallel/multithreading-support-for-older-code-visual-cpp.md).  
  
 Declarations of thread local variables must use [extended attribute syntax](../cpp/declspec.md) and the `__declspec` keyword with the **thread** keyword. For example, the following code declares an integer thread local variable and initializes it with a value:  
  
```  
__declspec( thread ) int tls_i = 1;  
```  
  
 You must observe these guidelines when declaring thread local objects and variables:  
  
-   You can apply the **thread** attribute only to class and data declarations and definitions; **thread** cannot be used on function declarations or definitions.  
  
-   The use of the **thread** attribute may interfere with [delay loading](../build/reference/linker-support-for-delay-loaded-dlls.md) of DLL imports**.**  
  
-   On XP systems, `thread` may not function correctly if a DLL uses __declspec(thread) data and it is loaded dynamically via LoadLibrary.  
  
-   You can specify the **thread** attribute only on data items with static storage duration. This includes global data objects (both **static** and `extern`), local static objects, and static data members of classes. You cannot declare automatic data objects with the **thread** attribute.  
  
-   You must use the **thread** attribute for the declaration and the definition of a thread local object, whether the declaration and definition occur in the same file or separate files.  
  
-   You cannot use the **thread** attribute as a type modifier.  
  
-   Because the declaration of objects that use the **thread** attribute is permitted, these two examples are semantically equivalent:  
  
    ```  
    // declspec_thread_2.cpp  
    // compile with: /LD  
    __declspec( thread ) class B {  
    public:  
       int data;  
    } BObject;   // BObject declared thread local.  
  
    class B2 {  
    public:  
       int data;  
    };  
    __declspec( thread ) B2 BObject2;   // BObject2 declared thread local.  
    ```  
  
-   Standard C permits initialization of an object or variable with an expression involving a reference to itself, but only for objects of nonstatic extent. Although C++ normally permits such dynamic initialization of an object with an expression involving a reference to itself, this type of initialization is not permitted with thread local objects. For example:  
  
    ```  
    // declspec_thread_3.cpp  
    // compile with: /LD  
    #define Thread __declspec( thread )  
    int j = j;   // Okay in C++; C error  
    Thread int tls_i = sizeof( tls_i );   // Okay in C and C++  
    ```  
  
     Note that a `sizeof` expression that includes the object being initialized does not constitute a reference to itself and is allowed in C and C++.
