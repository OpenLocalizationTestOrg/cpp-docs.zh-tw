# Equality Operators: == and !=
## Syntax  
  
```  
expression == expression  
expression != expression  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The binary equality operators compare their operands for strict equality or inequality.  
  
 The equality operators, equal to (`==`) and not equal to (`!=`), have lower precedence than the relational operators, but they behave similarly. The result type for these operators is `bool`.  
  
 The equal-to operator (`==`) returns **true** (1) if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns **false** (0). The not-equal-to operator (`!=`) returns **true** if the operands do not have the same value; otherwise, it returns **false**.  
  
## Operator Keyword for !=  
 The `not_eq` operator is the text equivalent of `!=`. There are two ways to access the `not_eq` operator in your programs: include the header file `iso646.h`, or compile with the [/Za](../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md) (Disable language extensions) compiler option.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// expre_Equality_Operators.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <iostream>  
  
using namespace std;  
  
int main() {  
   cout  << boolalpha  
         << "The true expression 3 != 2 yields: "  
         << (3 != 2) << endl  
         << "The false expression 20 == 10 yields: "  
         << (20 == 10) << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 Equality operators can compare pointers to members of the same type. In such a comparison, pointer-to-member conversions are performed. Pointers to members can also be compared to a constant expression that evaluates to 0.
