# Additional Startup Considerations
In C++, object construction and destruction can involve executing user code. Therefore, it is important to understand which initializations happen before entry to **main** and which destructors are invoked after exit from **main**. (For detailed information about construction and destruction of objects, see [Constructors](../cpp/constructors-cpp.md) and [Destructors](../cpp/destructors-cpp.md).)  
  
 The following initializations take place prior to entry to **main**:  
  
-   Default initialization of static data to zero. All static data without explicit initializers are set to zero prior to executing any other code, including run-time initialization. Static data members must still be explicitly defined.  
  
-   Initialization of global static objects in a translation unit. This may occur either before entry to **main** or before the first use of any function or object in the object's translation unit.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 In Microsoft C++, global static objects are initialized before entry to **main**.  
  
 **END Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Global static objects that are mutually interdependent but in different translation units may cause incorrect behavior.
