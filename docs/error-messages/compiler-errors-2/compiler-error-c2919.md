# Compiler Error C2919
'type': Operators cannot be used on the published surface of a WinRT type  
  
 The Windows Runtime type system does not support operator member functions in the published surface of a type. This is because not all languages can consume operator member functions. You can create private or internal operator member functions that can be called from C++ code in the same class or compilation unit.  
  
 To fix this issue, remove the operator member function from the public interface, or change it to a named member function. For example, instead of `operator==`, name the member function `Equals`.
