# NMAKE Fatal Error U1035
syntax error : expected ':' or '=' separator  
  
 Either a colon (**:**) or an equal sign (**=**) was expected.  
  
### To fix by checking the following possible causes  
  
1.  A colon did not follow a target.  
  
2.  A colon and no space (such as a:) followed a single-letter target. NMAKE interpreted it as a drive specification.  
  
3.  A colon did not follow an inference rule.  
  
4.  A macro definition was not followed by an equal sign.  
  
5.  A character followed a backslash (**\\**) that was used to continue a command to a new line.  
  
6.  A string appeared that did not follow any NMAKE syntax rule.  
  
7.  The makefile was formatted by a word processor.
