# Linker Tools Error LNK1181
cannot open input file 'filename'  
  
 The linker could not find `filename` because it does not exist or the path was not found.  
  
 Some common causes for error LNK1181 include:  
  
-   `filename` is referenced as an additional dependency on the linker line, but the file does not exist.  
  
-   A **/LIBPATH** statement that specifies the directory containing `filename` is missing.  
  
 To resolve the above issues, ensure any files referenced on the linker line are present on the system.  Also ensure there is a **/LIBPATH** statement for each directory containing a linker-dependent file.  
  
 Another possible cause for LNK1181 is that a long file name with embedded spaces was not enclosed in quotation marks.  In that case, the linker will only recognize a file name up to the first space, and then assume a file extension of .obj.  The solution to this situation is to enclose the long file name (path plus file name) in quotation marks.  
  
 For more information, see [.lib Files as Linker Input](../../build/reference/dot-lib-files-as-linker-input.md).
