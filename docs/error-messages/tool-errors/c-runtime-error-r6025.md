# C Runtime Error R6025
pure virtual function call  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you encounter this error message while running an app, the app was shut down because it has an internal problem. The most common reason for this error is a bug in the app, or a corrupted installation.  
>   
>  You can try these steps to fix this error:  
>   
>  -   Use the **Apps and Features** or **Programs and Features** page in the **Control Panel** to repair or reinstall the program.  
> -   Check **Windows Update** in the **Control Panel** for software updates.  
> -   Check for an updated version of the app. Contact the app vendor if the problem persists.  
  
 **Information for Programmers**  
  
 No object has been instantiated to handle the pure virtual function call.  
  
 This error is caused by calling a virtual function in an abstract base class through a pointer which is created by a cast to the type of the derived class, but is actually a pointer to the base class. This can occur when casting from a **void\*** to a pointer to a class when the **void\*** was created during the construction of the base class.
