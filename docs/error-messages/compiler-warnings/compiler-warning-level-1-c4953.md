# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4953
Inlinee 'function' has been edited since profile data was collected, profile data not used  
  
 When using [/LTCG:PGUPDATE](../../build/reference/ltcg-link-time-code-generation.md), the compiler detected an input module that was recompiled after `/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT` and has a function (***function***) that was edited and where existing test runs identified the function as a candidate for inlining. However, as a result of recompiling the module, the function will no longer be a candidate for inlining.  
  
 This warning is informational. To resolve this warning, run `/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT`, redo all test runs, and run `/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE`.  
  
 This warning would be replaced with an error if `/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE` had been used.
