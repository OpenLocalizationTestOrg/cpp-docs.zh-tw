# Win32 Internet Extensions (WinInet)
An Internet client application is a program that accesses information from a network data source (server) using Internet protocols such as gopher, FTP, or HTTP. An Internet client application might access a server to retrieve data such as weather maps, stock prices, or newspaper headlines, for example. The Internet client can access the server through an external network (the Internet) or an internal network (sometimes called an intranet).  
  
 MFC includes the Win32 Internet Extensions, or WinInet, for creating an Internet client application. MFC encapsulates these Internet extensions in a set of standard, easy-to-use classes. You can write a WinInet client application by calling the Win32 functions directly or by using the MFC WinInet classes.  
  
 The Microsoft Win32 Internet functions (WinInet) assist you in making the Internet an integral part of any application. The new functions, contained in WININET.DLL, simplify accessing the Internet using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and gopher.  
  
 The following topics discuss the process of creating an Internet client application:
