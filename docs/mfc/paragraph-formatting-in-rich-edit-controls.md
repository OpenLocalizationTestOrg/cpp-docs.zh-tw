# Paragraph Formatting in Rich Edit Controls
You can use member functions of the rich edit control ([CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md)) to format paragraphs and to retrieve formatting information. Paragraph formatting attributes include alignment, tabs, indents, and numbering.  
  
 You can apply paragraph formatting by using the [SetParaFormat](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__setparaformat) member function. To determine the current paragraph formatting for the selected text, use the [GetParaFormat](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__getparaformat) member function. The [PARAFORMAT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787940) structure is used with these member functions to specify paragraph attributes. One of the important members of **PARAFORMAT** is **dwMask**. In `SetParaFormat`, **dwMask** specifies which paragraph attributes will be set by this function call. `GetParaFormat` reports the attributes of the first paragraph in the selection; **dwMask** specifies the attributes that are consistent throughout the selection.
