## Remarks  
 A "rich edit control" is a window in which the user can enter and edit text. The text can be assigned character and paragraph formatting, and can include embedded OLE objects. Rich edit controls provide a programming interface for formatting text. However, an application must implement any user interface components necessary to make formatting operations available to the user.  
  
 This Windows Common control (and therefore the `CRichEditCtrl` class) is available only to programs running under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT versions 3.51 and later. The `CRichEditCtrl` class supports versions 2.0 and 3.0 of the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] rich edit control.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  If you are using a rich edit control in a dialog box (regardless whether your application is SDI, MDI, or dialog-based), you must call [AfxInitRichEdit](application-information-and-management.md#afxinitrichedit) once before the dialog box is displayed. A typical place to call this function is in your program's `InitInstance` member function. You do not need to call it for each time you display the dialog box, only the first time. You do not have to call `AfxInitRichEdit` if you are working with `CRichEditView`.

```  
BOOL CanUndo() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the last edit operation can be undone by a call to the [Undo](#cricheditctrl__undo) member function; 0 if it cannot be undone.  
  
### Remarks  
 For more information, see [EM_CANUNDO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775468) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#2](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_2.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__charfrompos"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CharFromPos  
 Retrieves information about the character at the point specified by the parameter `pt`.  
  
```  
int CharFromPos(CPoint pt) const;

 
```

 `pt`  
 A [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object containing the coordinates of the specified point.  
  
### Return Value  
 The zero-based character index of the character nearest the specified point. If the specified point is beyond the last character in the control, the return value indicates the last character in the control.  
  
### Remarks  
 This member function works with a rich edit control. To get the information for an edit control, call [CEdit::CharFromPos](../../mfc/reference/cedit-class.md#cedit__charfrompos).  
  
 For more information, see [EM_CHARFROMPOS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761566) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__clear"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Clear  
 Deletes (clears) the current selection (if any) in the rich edit control.  
  
```  
void Clear();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The deletion performed by **Clear** can be undone by calling the [Undo](#cricheditctrl__undo) member function.  
  
 To delete the current selection and place the deleted contents onto the Clipboard, call the [Cut](#cricheditctrl__cut) member function.  
  
 For more information, see [WM_CLEAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649020) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#3](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_3.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__copy"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Copy  
 Copies the current selection (if any) in the rich edit control to the Clipboard.  
  
```  
void Copy();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 For more information, see [WM_COPY](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649022) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#4](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_4.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__create"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Create  
 Creates the Windows rich edit control and associates it with this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL Create(
    DWORD dwStyle,  
    const RECT& rect,  
    CWnd* pParentWnd,  
    UINT nID);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `dwStyle`  
 Specifies the edit control's style. Apply a combination of the window styles listed in the **Remarks** section below, and [edit control styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775464), described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
 `rect`  
 Specifies the edit control's size and position. Can be a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) structure.  
  
 `pParentWnd`  
 Specifies the edit control's parent window (often a [CDialog](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md)). It must not be **NULL**.  
  
 `nID`  
 Specifies the edit control's ID.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if initialization is successful; otherwise, 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 You construct a `CRichEditCtrl` object in two steps. First, call the [CRichEditCtrl](#cricheditctrl__cricheditctrl) constructor, then call **Create**, which creates the Windows edit control and attaches it to the `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
 When you create a rich edit control with this function, first you must load the necessary common controls library. To load the libary, call the global function [AfxInitRichEdit](application-information-and-management.md#afxinitrichedit), which in turn initializes the common controls library. You need to call `AfxInitRichEdit` only once in your process.  
  
 When **Create** executes, Windows sends the [WM_NCCREATE](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccreate), [WM_NCCALCSIZE](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccalcsize), [WM_CREATE](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate), and [WM_GETMINMAXINFO](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__ongetminmaxinfo) messages to the edit control.  
  
 These messages are handled by default by the [OnNcCreate](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccreate), [OnNcCalcSize](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccalcsize), [OnCreate](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate), and [OnGetMinMaxInfo](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__ongetminmaxinfo) member functions in the `CWnd` base class. To extend the default message handling, derive a class from `CRichEditCtrl`, add a message map to the new class, and override the above message-handler member functions. Override `OnCreate`, for example, to perform needed initialization for the new class.  
  
 Apply the following [window styles](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md) to an edit control.  
  
- **WS_CHILD** Always.  
  
- **WS_VISIBLE** Usually.  
  
- **WS_DISABLED** Rarely.  
  
- **WS_GROUP** To group controls.  
  
- **WS_TABSTOP** To include edit control in the tabbing order.  
  
 For more information about window styles, see [CreateWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632679) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#5](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_5.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__createex"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CreateEx  
 Creates a control (a child window) and associates it with the `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL CreateEx(
    DWORD dwExStyle,  
    DWORD dwStyle,  
    const RECT& rect,  
    CWnd* pParentWnd,  
    UINT nID);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `dwExStyle`  
 Specifies the extended style of the control being created. For a list of extended Windows styles, see the `dwExStyle` parameter for [CreateWindowEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632680) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
 `dwStyle`  
 Specifies the edit control's style. Apply a combination of the window styles listed in the **Remarks** section of [Create](#cricheditctrl__create) and [edit control styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775464), described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
 `rect`  
 A reference to a [RECT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162897) structure describing the size and position of the window to be created, in client coordinates of `pParentWnd`.  
  
 `pParentWnd`  
 A pointer to the window that is the control's parent.  
  
 `nID`  
 The control's child-window ID.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use `CreateEx` instead of **Create** to apply extended Windows styles, specified by the Windows extended style preface **WS_EX_**.  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__cricheditctrl"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CRichEditCtrl  
 Constructs a `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
CRichEditCtrl();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Use [Create](#cricheditctrl__create) to construct the Windows rich edit control.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#6](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_6.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__cut"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Cut  
 Delete (cuts) the current selection (if any) in the rich edit control and copies the deleted text to the Clipboard.  
  
```  
void Cut();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The deletion performed by **Cut** can be undone by calling the [Undo](#cricheditctrl__undo) member function.  
  
 To delete the current selection without placing the deleted text into the Clipboard, call the [Clear](#cricheditctrl__clear) member function.  
  
 For more information, see [WM_CUT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649023) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#7](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_7.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__displayband"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::DisplayBand  
 Displays a portion of the contents of the rich edit control (text and OLE items), as previously formatted by [FormatRange](#cricheditctrl__formatrange).  
  
```  
BOOL DisplayBand(LPRECT pDisplayRect);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pDisplayRect`  
 Pointer to a [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) or [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object specifying the area of the device to display the text.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the display of the formatted text succeeds, otherwise, 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 The text and OLE items are clipped to the area specified by the pointer `pDisplayRect`.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_DISPLAYBAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787997) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example

 For more information, see [EM_GETTEXTRANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774199) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
 `GetTextRange` supports the Rich Edit 2.0 functionality. See [About Rich Edit Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787873) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)]for more information.  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__getundoname"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::GetUndoName  
 Retrieves the type of the next available action in the undo queue, if any.  
  
```  
UNDONAMEID GetUndoName() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 If an undo action is in the control's undo queue, `GetUndoName` returns the [UNDONAMEID](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774365) enumeration type indicating the type of the next action in the queue. If the undo queue is empty, or if the undo action in the queue is of an unknown type, `GetUndoName` returns 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 The types of actions that can be undone or redone include typing, delete, drag-drop, cut, and paste operations. This information can be useful for applications that provide an extended user interface for Undo and Redo operations, such as a drop-down list box of actions that can be undone.  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__getwordwrapmode"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::GetWordWrapMode  
 Retrieves the current word wrapping and word breaking options for the rich edit control.  
  
```  
UINT GetWordWrapMode() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The current word wrapping and word breaking options. These options are described in [EM_SETWORDWRAPMODE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774294) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Remarks  
 This member function is available only for Asian-language versions of the operating system.  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__hideselection"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::HideSelection  
 Changes the visibility of the selection.  
  
```  
void HideSelection(
    BOOL bHide,  
    BOOL bPerm);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `bHide`  
 Indicates if the selection should be shown or hidden, **TRUE** to hide the selection.  
  
 `bPerm`  
 Indicates if this change in visibility for the selection should be permanent.  
  
### Remarks  
 When `bPerm` is **TRUE**, it changes the `ECO_NOHIDESEL` option for this `CRichEditCtrl` object. For a brief description of this option, see [SetOptions](#cricheditctrl__setoptions). You can use this function to set all the options for this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_HIDESELECTION](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774210) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#18](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_18.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__limittext"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::LimitText  
 Limits the length of the text that the user can enter into an edit control.  
  
```  
void LimitText(long nChars = 0);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nChars`  
 Specifies the length (in bytes) of the text that the user can enter. If this parameter is 0 (the default value), the text length is set to 64K bytes.  
  
### Remarks  
 Changing the text limit restricts only the text the user can enter. It has no effect on any text already in the edit control, nor does it affect the length of the text copied to the edit control by the [SetWindowText](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__setwindowtext) member function in `CWnd`. If an application uses the `SetWindowText` function to place more text into an edit control than is specified in the call to `LimitText`, the user can delete any of the text within the edit control. However, the text limit will prevent the user from replacing the existing text with new text, unless deleting the current selection causes the text to fall below the text limit.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the text limit, each OLE item counts as a single character.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_EXLIMITTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb788003) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].

##  <a name="cricheditctrl__linefromchar"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::LineFromChar  
 Retrieves the line number of the line that contains the specified character index.  
  
```  
long LineFromChar(long nIndex) const;

 
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nIndex`  
 Contains the zero-based index value for the desired character in the text of the edit control, or contains –1. If `nIndex` is –1, it specifies the current line, that is, the line that contains the caret.  
  
### Return Value  
 The zero-based line number of the line containing the character index specified by `nIndex`. If `nIndex` is –1, the number of the line that contains the first character of the selection is returned. If there is no selection, the current line number is returned.  
  
### Remarks  
 A character index is the number of characters from the beginning of the rich edit control. For character counting, an OLE item is counted as a single character.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_EXLINEFROMCHAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb788005) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].

##  <a name="cricheditctrl__lineindex"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::LineIndex  
 Retrieves the character index of a line within this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
int LineIndex(int nLine = -1) const;

 
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nLine`  
 Contains the index value for the desired line in the text of the edit control, or contains –1. If `nLine` is –1, it specifies the current line, that is, the line that contains the caret.  
  
### Return Value  
 The character index of the line specified in `nLine` or –1 if the specified line number is greater then the number of lines in the edit control.  
  
### Remarks  
 The character index is the number of characters from the beginning of the rich edit control to the specified line.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_LINEINDEX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761611) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].

##  <a name="cricheditctrl__linelength"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::LineLength  
 Retrieves the length of a line in a rich edit control.  
  
```  
int LineLength(int nLine = -1) const;

 
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nLine`  
 Specifies the character index of a character in the line whose length is to be retrieved. If this parameter is –1, the length of the current line (the line that contains the caret) is returned, not including the length of any selected text within the line. When `LineLength` is called for a single-line edit control, this parameter is ignored.  
  
### Return Value  
 When `LineLength` is called for a multiple-line edit control, the return value is the length (in bytes) of the line specified by `nLine`. When `LineLength` is called for a single-line edit control, the return value is the length (in bytes) of the text in the edit control.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use the [LineIndex](#cricheditctrl__lineindex) member function to retrieve a character index for a given line number within this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_LINELENGTH](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761613) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].

##  <a name="cricheditctrl__linescroll"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::LineScroll  
 Scrolls the text of a multiple-line edit control.  
  
```  
void LineScroll(
    int nLines,  
    int nChars = 0);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nLines`  
 Specifies the number of lines to scroll vertically.  
  
 `nChars`  
 Specifies the number of character positions to scroll horizontally. This value is ignored if the rich edit control has either the **ES_RIGHT** or **ES_CENTER** style. [Edit styles](../../mfc/reference/edit-styles.md) are specified in [Create](#cricheditctrl__create).  
  
### Remarks  
 The edit control does not scroll vertically past the last line of text in the edit control. If the current line plus the number of lines specified by `nLines` exceeds the total number of lines in the edit control, the value is adjusted so that the last line of the edit control is scrolled to the top of the edit-control window.  
  
 `LineScroll` can be used to scroll horizontally past the last character of any line.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_LINESCROLL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761615) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].

### Remarks  
 This `CRichEditCtrl` object will call [IUnknown::AddRef](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms691379) to increment the usage count for the COM object specified by `pCallback`.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_SETOLECALLBACK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774252) message and [IRichEditOleCallback](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774308) interface in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__setoptions"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetOptions  
 Sets the options for this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
void SetOptions(
    WORD wOp,  
    DWORD dwFlags);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *wOp*  
 Indicates the type of operation. One of the following values:  
  
- `ECOOP_SET` Set the options to those specified by `dwFlags`.  
  
- `ECOOP_OR` Combine the current options with those specified by `dwFlags`.  
  
- `ECOOP_AND` Retain only those current options that are also specified by `dwFlags`.  
  
- `ECOOP_XOR` Retain only those current options that are *not* specified by `dwFlags`.  
  
 `dwFlags`  
 Rich edit options. The flag values are listed in the Remarks section.  
  
### Remarks  
 The options can be a combination of the following values:  
  
- `ECO_AUTOWORDSELECTION` Automatic word selection on double-click.  
  
- `ECO_AUTOVSCROLL` Automatically scrolls text to the right by 10 characters when the user types a character at the end of the line. When the user presses the ENTER key, the control scrolls all text back to position zero.  
  
- `ECO_AUTOHSCROLL` Automatically scrolls text up one page when the user presses the ENTER key on the last line.  
  
- `ECO_NOHIDESEL` Negates the default behavior for an edit control. The default behavior hides the selection when the control loses the input focus and shows the selection when the control receives the input focus. If you specify `ECO_NOHIDESEL`, the selected text is inverted, even if the control does not have the focus.  
  
- `ECO_READONLY` Prevents the user from typing or editing text in the edit control.  
  
- `ECO_WANTRETURN` Specifies that a carriage return be inserted when the user presses the ENTER key while entering text into a multiple-line rich edit control in a dialog box. If you do not specify this style, pressing the ENTER key sends a command to the rich edit control's parent window, which mimics clicking the parent window's default button (for example, the OK button in a dialog box). This style has no effect on a single-line edit control.  
  
- `ECO_SAVESEL` Preserves the selection when the control loses the focus. By default, the entire contents of the control are selected when it regains the focus.  
  
- `ECO_VERTICAL` Draws text and objects in a vertical direction. Available for Asian languages only.

 `lpPunc`  
 A pointer to a [PUNCTUATION](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787944) structure, as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful, otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 This member function is available for only Asian-language versions of the operating system.  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__setreadonly"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetReadOnly  
 Changes the `ECO_READONLY` option for this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
BOOL SetReadOnly(BOOL bReadOnly = TRUE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `bReadOnly`  
 Indicates if this `CRichEditCtrl` object should be read only.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise, 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 For a brief description of this option, see [SetOptions](#cricheditctrl__setoptions). You can use this function to set all the options for this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_SETREADONLY](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761655) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#29](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_29.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__setrect"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetRect  
 Sets the formatting rectangle for this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
void SetRect(LPCRECT lpRect);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `lpRect`  
 [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) or pointer to a [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that indicates the new bounds for the formatting rectangle.  
  
### Remarks  
 The formatting rectangle is the limiting rectangle for the text. The limiting rectangle is independent of the size of the rich edit control window. When this `CRichEditCtrl` object is first created, the formatting rectangle is the same size as the client area of the window. Use `SetRect` to make the formatting rectangle larger or smaller than the rich edit window.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_SETRECT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761657) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#30](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_30.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__setsel"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetSel  
 Sets the selection within this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
void SetSel(
    long nStartChar,  
    long nEndChar);

 
void SetSel(
    CHARRANGE& cr);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nStartChar`  
 Zero-based index of the first character for the selection.  
  
 `nEndChar`  
 Zero-based index of the last character for the selection.  
  
 `cr`  
 [CHARRANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787885) structure which holds the bounds of the current selection.  
  
### Remarks  
 The two forms of this function provide alternate ways to set the bounds for the selection. Brief descriptions of these forms follow:  
  
- **SetSel(** `cr` **)** This form uses the **CHARRANGE** structure with its **cpMin** and **cpMax** members to set the bounds.  
  
- **SetSel(** `nStartChar` **,** `nEndChar` **)** This form use the parameters `nStartChar` and `nEndChar` to set the bounds.  
  
 The caret is placed at the end of the selection indicated by the greater of the start ( **cpMin** or `nStartChar`) and end ( **cpMax** or `nEndChar`) indices. This function scrolls the contents of the `CRichEditCtrl` so that the caret is visible.  
  
 To select all the text in this `CRichEditCtrl` object, call `SetSel` with a start index of 0 and an end index of – 1.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_EXSETSEL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb788007) message and [CHARRANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787885) structure in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
  See the example for [GetSel](#cricheditctrl__getsel).  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__setselectioncharformat"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetSelectionCharFormat  
 Sets the character formatting attributes for the text in the current selection in this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
BOOL SetSelectionCharFormat(CHARFORMAT& cf);

 
BOOL SetSelectionCharFormat(CHARFORMAT2& cf);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `cf`  
 In the first version, a pointer to a [CHARFORMAT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787881) structure containing the new character formatting attributes for the current selection.  
  
 In the second version, a pointer to a [CHARFORMAT2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787883) structure, which is a Rich Edit 2.0 extension to the **CHARFORMAT** structure, containing the new character formatting attributes for the current selection.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise, 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 Only the attributes specified by the **dwMask** member of `cf` are changed by this function.  
  
 For more information, see the [EM_SETCHARFORMAT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774230) and the **CHARFORMAT** and **CHARFORMAT2** structures in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#31](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_31.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="cricheditctrl__settargetdevice"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetTargetDevice  
 Sets the target device and line width used for WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) formatting in this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
```  
BOOL SetTargetDevice(
    HDC hDC,  
    long lLineWidth);

 
BOOL SetTargetDevice(
    CDC& dc,

 *lLineWidth*  
 Line width to use for formatting.  
  
 `dc`  
 [CDC](../../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md) for the new target device.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise, 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 If this function is successful, the rich edit control owns the device context passed as a parameter. In that case, the calling function should not destroy the device context.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_SETTARGETDEVICE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774282) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].

```  
long StreamIn(
    int nFormat,  
    EDITSTREAM& es);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nFormat`  
 Flags specifying the input data formats. See the Remarks section for more information.  
  
 `es`  
 [EDITSTREAM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787891) structure specifying the input stream. See the Remarks section for more information.
