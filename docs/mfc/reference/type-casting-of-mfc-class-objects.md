# Type Casting of MFC Class Objects
Type casting macros provide a way to cast a given pointer to a pointer that points to an object of specific class, with or without checking that the cast is legal.  
  
 The following table lists the MFC type casting macros.  
  
### Macros That Cast Pointers to MFC Class Objects  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[DYNAMIC_DOWNCAST](#dynamic_downcast)|Casts a pointer to a pointer to a class object while checking to see if the cast is legal.|  
|[STATIC_DOWNCAST](#static_downcast)|Casts a pointer to an object from one class to a pointer of a related type. In a debug build, causes an **ASSERT** if the object is not a "kind of" the target type.|  
  
##  <a name="dynamic_downcast"></a>  DYNAMIC_DOWNCAST  
 Provides a handy way to cast a pointer to a pointer to a class object while checking to see if the cast is legal.  
  
```   
DYNAMIC_DOWNCAST(class, pointer)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `class`  
 The name of a class.  
  
 `pointer`  
 A pointer to be cast to a pointer to an object of type `class`.  
  
### Remarks  
 The macro will cast the `pointer` parameter to a pointer to an object of the `class` parameter's type.  
  
 If the object referenced by the pointer is a "kind of" the identified class, the macro returns the appropriate pointer. If it is not a legal cast, the macro returns **NULL**.  
  
##  <a name="static_downcast"></a>  STATIC_DOWNCAST  
 Casts *pobject* to a pointer to a *class_name* object.  
  
```   
STATIC_DOWNCAST(class_name, pobject)   
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *class_name*  
 The name of the class being cast to.  
  
 *pobject*  
 The pointer to be cast to a pointer to a *class_name* object.  
  
### Remarks  
 *pobject* must either be **NULL**, or point to an object of a class which is derived directly, or indirectly, from *class_name*. In builds of your application with the **_DEBUG** preprocessor symbol defined, the macro will **ASSERT** if *pobject* is not **NULL**, or if it points to an object that is not a "kind of" the class specified in the *class_name* parameter (see [CObject::IsKindOf](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md#cobject__iskindof)). In non- **_DEBUG** builds, the macro performs the cast without any type checking.  
  
 The class specified in the *class_name* parameter must be derived from `CObject` and must use the `DECLARE_DYNAMIC` and `IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC`, the `DECLARE_DYNCREATE` and `IMPLEMENT_DYNCREATE`, or the `DECLARE_SERIAL` and `IMPLEMENT_SERIAL` macros as explained in the article [CObject Class: Deriving a Class from CObject](../../mfc/deriving-a-class-from-cobject.md).  
  
 For example, you might cast a pointer to `CMyDoc`, called `pMyDoc`, to a pointer to **CDocument** using this expression:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#197](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/type-casting-of-mfc-class-objects_1.cpp)]  
  
 If `pMyDoc` does not point to an object derived directly or indirectly from **CDocument**, the macro will **ASSERT**.
