## Remarks  
 The CAnimationController class is the key class that manages animations. You may create one or more instances of animation controller in an application and, optionally, connect an instance of animation controller to a CWnd object using CAnimationController::SetRelatedWnd. This connection is required to send WM_PAINT messages to the related window automatically when animation manager status has changed or animation timer has been updated. If you do not enable this relation, you must redraw a window that displays an animation manually. For this purpose you can derive a class from CAnimationController and override OnAnimationManagerStatusChanged and/or OnAnimationTimerPostUpdate and invalidate one or more windows when necessary.  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  
  
 [CAnimationController](../../mfc/reference/canimationcontroller-class.md)  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxanimationcontroller.h  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller___dtorcanimationcontroller"></a>  CAnimationController::~CAnimationController  
 The destructor. Called when animation controller object is being destroyed.  
  
```  
virtual ~CAnimationController(void);
```   
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__addanimationobject"></a>  CAnimationController::AddAnimationObject  
 Adds an animation object to a group that belongs to the animation controller.  
  
```  
CAnimationGroup* AddAnimationObject(CAnimationBaseObject* pObject);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pObject`  
 A pointer to an animation object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to existing or new animation group where pObject has been added if function succeeds; NULL if pObject has already been added to a group that belongs to another animation controller.  
  
### Remarks  
 Call this method to add an animation object to the animation controller. An object will be added to a group according to object's GroupID (see CAnimationBaseObject::SetID). The animation controller will create a new group if it's the first object being added with the specified GroupID. An animation object can be added to one animation controller only. If you need to add an object to another controller, call RemoveAnimationObject first. If you call SetID with new GroupID for an object that has been already added to a group, the object will be removed from the old group and added to another group with specified ID.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__addkeyframetogroup"></a>  CAnimationController::AddKeyframeToGroup  
 Adds a keyframe to group.  
  
```  
BOOL AddKeyframeToGroup(
    UINT32 nGroupID,  
    CBaseKeyFrame* pKeyframe);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies Group ID.  
  
 `pKeyframe`  
 A pointer to a keyframe.  
  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if the function succeeds; otherwise FALSE.  
  
### Remarks  
 Usually you don't need to call this method, use CAnimationController::CreateKeyframe instead, which creates and adds the created keyframe to a group automatically.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__animategroup"></a>  CAnimationController::AnimateGroup  
 Prepares a group to run animation and optionally schedules it.  
  
```  
BOOL AnimateGroup(
    UINT32 nGroupID,  
    BOOL bScheduleNow = TRUE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies GroupID.  
  
 `bScheduleNow`  
 Specifies whether to run animation right away.  
  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if animation was successfully scheduled and run.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method does the actual work creating storyboard, adding animation variables, applying transitions and setting keyframes. It's possible to delay scheduling if you set bScheduleNow to FALSE. In this case the specified group will hold a storyboard that has been set up for animation. At that point you can setup events for the storyboard and animation variables. When you actually need to run the animation call CAnimationController::ScheduleGroup.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__canimationcontroller"></a>  CAnimationController::CAnimationController  
 Constructs an animation controller.  
  
```  
CAnimationController(void);
```   
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__cleanupgroup"></a>  CAnimationController::CleanUpGroup  
 Called by the framework to clean up the group when animation has been scheduled.  
  
```  
void CleanUpGroup(UINT32 nGroupID);

 
void CleanUpGroup(CAnimationGroup* pGroup);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies GroupID.  
  
 `pGroup`  
 A pointer to animation group to clean.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method removes all transitions and keyframes from the specified group, because they are not relevant after an animation has been scheduled.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__createkeyframe"></a>  CAnimationController::CreateKeyframe  
 Creates a keyframe that depends on transition and adds it to the specified group.  
  
```  
CKeyFrame* CreateKeyframe(
    UINT32 nGroupID,  
    CBaseTransition* pTransition);

 
CKeyFrame* CreateKeyframe(
    UINT32 nGroupID,  
    CBaseKeyFrame* pKeyframe,  
    UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS offset = 0.0);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies Group ID for which keyframe is created.  
  
 `pTransition`  
 A pointer to transition. Keyframe will be inserted to storyboard after this transition.  
  
 `pKeyframe`  
 A pointer to base keyframe for this keyframe.  
  
 `offset`  
 Offset in seconds from the base keyframe specified by pKeyframe.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to newly created keyframe if the function succeeds.  
  
### Remarks  
 You can store the returned pointer and base other keyframes on the newly created keyframe (see the second overload). It's possible to begin transitions at keyframes - see CBaseTransition::SetKeyframes. You don't need to delete keyframes created in this way, because they are deleted automatically by animation groups. Be careful when creating keyframes based on other keyframes and transitions and avoid circular references.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__enableanimationmanagerevent"></a>  CAnimationController::EnableAnimationManagerEvent  
 Sets or releases a handler to call when animation manager's status changes.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL EnableAnimationManagerEvent(BOOL bEnable = TRUE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `bEnable`  
 Specifies whether to set or release a handler.  
  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if the handler was successfully set or released.  
  
### Remarks  
 When a handler is set (enabled) Windows Animation calls OnAnimationManagerStatusChanged when animation manager's status changes.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__enableanimationtimereventhandler"></a>  CAnimationController::EnableAnimationTimerEventHandler  
 Sets or releases a handler for timing events and handler for timing updates.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL EnableAnimationTimerEventHandler(
    BOOL bEnable = TRUE,  
    UI_ANIMATION_IDLE_BEHAVIOR idleBehavior = UI_ANIMATION_IDLE_BEHAVIOR_DISABLE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `bEnable`  
 Specifies whether to set or release the handlers.  
  
 `idleBehavior`  
 Specifies idle behavior for timer update handler.  
  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if handlers were successfully set or released; FALSE if this method is called for a second time without releasing the handlers first, or if any other error occurs.  
  
### Remarks  
 When the handlers are set (enabled) Windows Animation API calls OnAnimationTimerPreUpdate, OnAnimationTimerPostUpdate, OnRenderingTooSlow methods. You need to enable animation timers to allow Windows Animation API update storyboards. Otherwise you'll need to call CAnimationController::UpdateAnimationManager in order to direct the animation manager to update the values of all animation variables.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__enableprioritycomparisonhandler"></a>  CAnimationController::EnablePriorityComparisonHandler  
 Sets or releases the priority comparison handler to call to determine whether a scheduled storyboard can be cancelled, concluded, trimmed or compressed.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL EnablePriorityComparisonHandler(DWORD dwHandlerType);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `dwHandlerType`  
 A combination of UI_ANIMATION_PHT_ flags (see remarks), which specifies what handlers to set or release.  
  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if the handler was successfully set or released.  
  
### Remarks  
 When a handler is set (enabled) Windows Animation calls the following virtual methods depending on dwHandlerType: OnHasPriorityCancel, OnHasPriorityConclude, OnHasPriorityTrim, OnHasPriorityCompress. dwHandler can be a combination of the following flags: UI_ANIMATION_PHT_NONE - release all handlers UI_ANIMATION_PHT_CANCEL - set Cancel comparison handler UI_ANIMATION_PHT_CONCLUDE - set Conclude comparison handler UI_ANIMATION_PHT_COMPRESS - set Compress comparison handler UI_ANIMATION_PHT_TRIM - set Trim comparison handler UI_ANIMATION_PHT_CANCEL_REMOVE - remove Cancel comparison handler UI_ANIMATION_PHT_CONCLUDE_REMOVE - remove Conclude comparison handler UI_ANIMATION_PHT_COMPRESS_REMOVE - remove Compress comparison handler UI_ANIMATION_PHT_TRIM_REMOVE - remove Trim comparison handler  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__enablestoryboardeventhandler"></a>  CAnimationController::EnableStoryboardEventHandler  
 Sets or releases a handler for storyboard status and update events.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL EnableStoryboardEventHandler(
    UINT32 nGroupID,  
    BOOL bEnable = TRUE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies Group ID.  
  
 `bEnable`  
 Specifies whether to set or release a handler.  
  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if the handler was successfully set or released; FALSE if the specified animation group is now found or animation for the specified group has not been initiated and its internal storyboard is NULL.  
  
### Remarks  
 When a handler is set (enabled) Windows Animation API calls OnStoryboardStatusChanges and OnStoryboardUpdated virtual methods. A handler must be set after CAnimationController::Animate has been called for the specified animation group, because it creates encapsulated IUIAnimationStoryboard object.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__findanimationgroup"></a>  CAnimationController::FindAnimationGroup  
 Finds an animation group by its Group ID.  
  
```  
CAnimationGroup* FindAnimationGroup(UINT32 nGroupID);

```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies a GroupID.  
  
 `pStoryboard`  
 A pointer to a storyboard.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to animation group or NULL if the group with specified ID is not found.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use this method to find an animation group at runtime. A group is created and added to the internal list of animation groups when a first animation object with particular GroupID is being added to animation controller.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__findanimationobject"></a>  CAnimationController::FindAnimationObject  
 Finds animation object containing a specified animation variable.  
  
```  
BOOL FindAnimationObject(
    IUIAnimationVariable* pVariable,  
    CAnimationBaseObject** ppObject,  
    CAnimationGroup** ppGroup);
```

##  <a name="canimationcontroller__removeallanimationgroups"></a>  CAnimationController::RemoveAllAnimationGroups  
 Removes all animation groups from animation controller.  
  
```  
void RemoveAllAnimationGroups();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 All groups will be deleted, their pointer, if stored at the application level, must be invalidated. If CAnimationGroup::m_bAutodestroyAnimationObjects for a group being deleted is TRUE, all animation objects that belong to that group will be deleted; otherwise their references to parent animation controller will be set to NULL and they can be added to another controller.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__removeanimationgroup"></a>  CAnimationController::RemoveAnimationGroup  
 Removes an animation group with specified ID from animation controller.  
  
```  
void RemoveAnimationGroup(UINT32 nGroupID);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies animation group ID.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method removes an animation group from the internal list of groups and deletes it, therefore if you stored a pointer to that animation group, it must be invalidated. If CAnimationGroup::m_bAutodestroyAnimationObjects is TRUE, all animation objects that belong to that group will be deleted; otherwise their references to parent animation controller will be set to NULL and they can be added to another controller.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__removeanimationobject"></a>  CAnimationController::RemoveAnimationObject  
 Remove an animation object from animation controller.  
  
```  
void RemoveAnimationObject(
    CAnimationBaseObject* pObject,  
    BOOL bNoDelete = FALSE);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pObject`  
 A pointer to an animation object.  
  
 `bNoDelete`  
 If this parameter is TRUE the object will not be deleted upon remove.  
  
### Remarks  
 Removes an animation object from animation controller and animation group. Call this function if a particular object should not be animated anymore, or if you need to move the object to another animation controller. In the last case bNoDelete must be TRUE.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__removetransitions"></a>  CAnimationController::RemoveTransitions  
 Removes transitions from animation objects that belong to the specified group.  
  
```  
void RemoveTransitions(UINT32 nGroupID);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies Group ID.  
  
### Remarks  
 The group loops over its animation objects and calls ClearTransitions(FALSE) for each animation object. This method is called by the framework after animation has been scheduled.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__schedulegroup"></a>  CAnimationController::ScheduleGroup  
 Schedules an animation.  
  
```  
BOOL ScheduleGroup(
    UINT32 nGroupID,  
    UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS time = 0.0);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nGroupID`  
 Specifies animation Group ID to schedule.  
  
 `time`  
 Specifies time to schedule.  
  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if animation was scheduled successfully. FALSE if storyboard has not been created, or other error occurs.  
  
### Remarks  
 You must call AnimateGroup with parameter bScheduleNow set to FALSE prior ScheduleGroup. You can specify the desired animation time obtained from IUIAnimationTimer::GetTime. If the time parameter is 0.0, the animation is scheduled for the current time.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__setrelatedwnd"></a>  CAnimationController::SetRelatedWnd  
 Establishes a relationship between animation controller and a window.  
  
```  
void SetRelatedWnd(CWnd* pWnd);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pWnd`  
 A pointer to window object to set.  
  
### Remarks  
 If a related CWnd object is set, the animation controller can automatically update it (send WM_PAINT message) when the status of animation manager has changed or timer post update event has occurred.  
  
##  <a name="canimationcontroller__updateanimationmanager"></a>  CAnimationController::UpdateAnimationManager  
 Directs the animation manager to update the values of all animation variables.  
  
```  
virtual void UpdateAnimationManager();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Calling this method advances the animation manager to current time, changing statuses of storyboards as necessary and updating any animation variables to appropriate interpolated values. Internally this method calls IUIAnimationTimer::GetTime(timeNow) and IUIAnimationManager::Update(timeNow). Override this method in a derived class to customize this behavior.
