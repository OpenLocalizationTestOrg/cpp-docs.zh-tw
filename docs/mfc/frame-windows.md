# Frame Windows
When an application runs under Windows, the user interacts with documents displayed in frame windows. A document frame window has two major components: the frame and the contents that it frames. A document frame window can be a [single document interface](../mfc/sdi-and-mdi.md) (SDI) frame window or a [multiple document interface](../mfc/sdi-and-mdi.md) (MDI) child window. Windows manages most of the user's interaction with the frame window: moving and resizing the window, closing it, and minimizing and maximizing it. You manage the contents inside the frame.  
  
## Frame Windows and Views  
 The MFC framework uses frame windows to contain views. The two components — frame and contents — are represented and managed by two different classes in MFC. A frame-window class manages the frame, and a view class manages the contents. The view window is a child of the frame window. Drawing and other user interaction with the document take place in the view's client area, not the frame window's client area. The frame window provides a visible frame around a view, complete with a caption bar and standard window controls such as a control menu, buttons to minimize and maximize the window, and controls for resizing the window. The "contents" consist of the window's client area, which is fully occupied by a child window — the view. The following figure shows the relationship between a frame window and a view.

## Frame Windows and Splitter Windows  
 Another common arrangement is for the frame window to frame multiple views, usually using a [splitter window](../mfc/multiple-document-types-views-and-frame-windows.md). In a splitter window, the frame window's client area is occupied by a splitter window, which in turn has multiple child windows, called panes, which are views.
