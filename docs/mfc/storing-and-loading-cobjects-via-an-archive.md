# Storing and Loading CObjects via an Archive
Storing and loading `CObject`s via an archive requires extra consideration. In certain cases, you should call the `Serialize` function of the object, where the `CArchive` object is a parameter of the `Serialize` call, as opposed to using the **<\<** or **>>** operator of the `CArchive`. The important fact to keep in mind is that the `CArchive` **>>** operator constructs the `CObject` in memory based on `CRuntimeClass` information previously written to the file by the storing archive.  
  
 Therefore, whether you use the `CArchive` **<\<** and **>>** operators, versus calling `Serialize`, depends on whether you *need* the loading archive to dynamically reconstruct the object based on previously stored `CRuntimeClass` information. Use the `Serialize` function in the following cases:  
  
-   When deserializing the object, you know the exact class of the object beforehand.  
  
-   When deserializing the object, you already have memory allocated for it.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  If you load the object using the `Serialize` function, you must also store the object using the `Serialize` function. Don't store using the `CArchive` **<<** operator and then load using the `Serialize` function, or store using the `Serialize` function and then load using **CArchive >>** operator.  
  
 The following example illustrates the cases:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCSerialization#36](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/storing-and-loading-cobjects-via-an-archive_1.h)]  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCSerialization#37](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/storing-and-loading-cobjects-via-an-archive_2.cpp)]  
  
 In summary, if your serializable class defines an embedded **CObjec**t as a member, you should *not* use the `CArchive` **<\<** and **>>** operators for that object, but should call the `Serialize` function instead. Also, if your serializable class defines a pointer to a `CObject` (or an object derived from `CObject`) as a member, but constructs this other object in its own constructor, you should also call `Serialize`.
