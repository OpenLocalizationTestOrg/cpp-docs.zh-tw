# One-Stage and Two-Stage Construction of Objects
You have a choice between two techniques for creating graphic objects, such as pens and brushes:  
  
-   *One-stage construction*: Construct and initialize the object in one stage, all with the constructor.  
  
-   *Two-stage construction*: Construct and initialize the object in two separate stages. The constructor creates the object and an initialization function initializes it.  
  
 Two-stage construction is always safer. In one-stage construction, the constructor could throw an exception if you provide incorrect arguments or memory allocation fails. That problem is avoided by two-stage construction, although you do have to check for failure. In either case, destroying the object is the same process.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These techniques apply to creating any objects, not just graphic objects.  
  
## Example of Both Construction Techniques  
 The following brief example shows both methods of constructing a pen object:
