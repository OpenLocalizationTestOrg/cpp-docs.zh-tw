# Using CTreeCtrl
A tree control, represented by the class [CTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctreectrl-class.md), is a window that displays a hierarchical list of items, such as the headings in a document, the entries in an index, or the files and directories on a disk. Each item consists of a label and an optional bitmapped image, and each item can have a list of subitems associated with it. By clicking an item, the user can expand and collapse the associated list of subitems. The directory tree in the left-hand pane of File Explorer is an example of a tree control.
