# OLE Control Classes
These are the primary classes you use when writing OLE controls. The `COleControlModule` class in an OLE control module is like the [CWinApp](../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md) class in an application. Each module implements one or more OLE controls; these controls are represented by `COleControl` objects. These controls communicate with their containers using `CConnectionPoint` objects.  
  
 The `CPictureHolder` and `CFontHolder` classes encapsulate COM interfaces for pictures and fonts, while the `COlePropertyPage` and `CPropExchange` classes help you implement property pages and property persistence for your control.  
  
 [COleControlModule](../mfc/reference/colecontrolmodule-class.md)  
 Replaces the `CWinApp` class for your OLE control module. Derive from the `COleControlModule` class to develop an OLE control module object. It provides member functions for initializing your OLE control's module.  
  
 [COleControl](../mfc/reference/colecontrol-class.md)  
 Derive from the `COleControl` class to develop an OLE control. Derived from `CWnd`, this class inherits all the functionality of a Windows window object plus additional OLE-specific functionality, such as event firing and the ability to support methods and properties.  
  
 [CConnectionPoint](../mfc/reference/cconnectionpoint-class.md)  
 The `CConnectionPoint` class defines a special type of interface used to communicate with other OLE objects, called a connection point. A connection point implements an outgoing interface that is able to initiate actions on other objects, such as firing events and change notifications.  
  
 [CPictureHolder](../mfc/reference/cpictureholder-class.md)  
 Encapsulates the functionality of a Windows picture object and the `IPicture` COM interface; used to implement the custom Picture property of an OLE control.  
  
 [CFontHolder](../mfc/reference/cfontholder-class.md)  
 Encapsulates the functionality of a Windows font object and the `IFont` COM interface; used to implement the stock Font property of an OLE control.  
  
 [COlePropertyPage](../mfc/reference/colepropertypage-class.md)  
 Displays the properties of an OLE control in a graphical interface, similar to a dialog box.  
  
 [CPropExchange](../mfc/reference/cpropexchange-class.md)  
 Supports the implementation of property persistence for your OLE controls. Analogous to [CDataExchange](../mfc/reference/cdataexchange-class.md) for dialog boxes.  
  
 [CMonikerFile](../mfc/reference/cmonikerfile-class.md)  
 Takes a moniker, or a string representation that it can make into a moniker, and binds it synchronously to the stream for which the moniker is a name.  
  
 [CAsyncMonikerFile](../mfc/reference/casyncmonikerfile-class.md)  
 Works similarly to `CMonikerFile`; however, it binds the moniker asynchronously to the stream for which the moniker is a name.  
  
 [CDataPathProperty](../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md)  
 Implements an OLE control property that can be loaded asynchronously.  
  
 [CCachedDataPathProperty](../mfc/reference/ccacheddatapathproperty-class.md)  
 Implements an OLE control property transferred asynchronously and cached in a memory file.  
  
 [COleCmdUI](../mfc/reference/colecmdui-class.md)  
 Allows an Active document to receive commands that originate in its container's user interface (such as FileNew, Open, Print, and so on), and allows a container to receive commands that originate in the Active document's user interface.  
  
 [COleSafeArray](../mfc/reference/colesafearray-class.md)  
 Works with arrays of arbitrary type and dimension.
