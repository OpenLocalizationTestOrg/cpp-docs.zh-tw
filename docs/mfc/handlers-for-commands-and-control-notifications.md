# Handlers for Commands and Control Notifications
There are no default handlers for commands or control-notification messages. Therefore, you are bound only by convention in naming your handlers for these categories of messages. When you map the command or control notification to a handler, the Properties windows proposes a name based on the command ID or control-notification code. You can accept the proposed name, change it, or replace it.  
  
 Convention suggests that you name handlers in both categories for the user-interface object they represent. Thus a handler for the Cut command on the Edit menu might be named  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCMessageHandling#4](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/handlers-for-commands-and-control-notifications_1.h)]  
  
 Because the Cut command is so commonly implemented in applications, the framework predefines the command ID for the Cut command as **ID_EDIT_CUT**. For a list of all predefined command IDs, see the file AFXRES.H. For more information, see [Standard Commands](../mfc/standard-commands.md).  
  
 In addition, convention suggests a handler for the **BN_CLICKED** notification message from a button labeled "My Button" might be named  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCMessageHandling#5](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/handlers-for-commands-and-control-notifications_2.h)]  
  
 You might assign this command an ID of `IDC_MY_BUTTON` because it is equivalent to an application-specific user-interface object.  
  
 Both categories of messages take no arguments and return no value.
