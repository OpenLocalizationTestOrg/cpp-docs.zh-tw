# Exceptions: Catching and Deleting Exceptions
The following instructions and examples show you how to catch and delete exceptions. For more information on the **try**, **catch**, and `throw` keywords, see [C++ Exception Handling](../cpp/cpp-exception-handling.md).  
  
 Your exception handlers must delete exception objects they handle, because failure to delete the exception causes a memory leak whenever that code catches an exception.  
  
 Your **catch** block must delete an exception when:  
  
-   The **catch** block throws a new exception.  
  
     Of course, you must not delete the exception if you throw the same exception again:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCExceptions#3](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/exceptions-catching-and-deleting-exceptions_1.cpp)]  
  
-   Execution returns from within the **catch** block.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When deleting a `CException`, use the **Delete** member function to delete the exception. Do not use the **delete** keyword, because it can fail if the exception is not on the heap.  
  
#### To catch and delete exceptions  
  
1.  Use the **try** keyword to set up a **try** block. Execute any program statements that might throw an exception within a **try** block.  
  
     Use the **catch** keyword to set up a **catch** block. Place exception-handling code in a **catch** block. The code in the **catch** block is executed only if the code within the **try** block throws an exception of the type specified in the **catch** statement.  
  
     The following skeleton shows how **try** and **catch** blocks are normally arranged:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCExceptions#4](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/exceptions-catching-and-deleting-exceptions_2.cpp)]  
  
     When an exception is thrown, control passes to the first **catch** block whose exception-declaration matches the type of the exception. You can selectively handle different types of exceptions with sequential **catch** blocks as listed below:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCExceptions#5](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/exceptions-catching-and-deleting-exceptions_3.cpp)]  
  
 For more information, see [Exceptions: Converting from MFC Exception Macros](../mfc/exceptions-converting-from-mfc-exception-macros.md).
