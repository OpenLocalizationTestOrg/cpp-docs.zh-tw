# Clipboard Operations in Rich Edit Controls
Your application can paste the contents of the Clipboard into a rich edit control ([CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md)) using either the best available Clipboard format or a specific Clipboard format. You can also determine whether a rich edit control is capable of pasting a Clipboard format.  
  
 You can copy or cut the contents of the current selection by using the [Copy](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__copy) or [Cut](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__cut) member function. Similarly, you can paste the contents of the Clipboard into a rich edit control by using the [Paste](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__paste) member function. The control pastes the first available format that it recognizes, which presumably is the most descriptive format.  
  
 To paste a specific Clipboard format, you can use the [PasteSpecial](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__pastespecial) member function. This function is useful for applications with a Paste Special command that enables the user to select the Clipboard format. You can use the [CanPaste](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__canpaste) member function to determine whether a given format is recognized by the control.  
  
 You can also use `CanPaste` to determine whether any available Clipboard format is recognized by a rich edit control. This function is useful in the `OnInitMenuPopup` handler. An application might enable or gray its Paste command depending on whether the control can paste any available format.  
  
 Rich edit controls register two Clipboard formats: rich-text format and a format called RichEdit Text and Objects. An application can register these formats by using the [RegisterClipboardFormat](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649049) function, specifying the **CF_RTF** and **CF_RETEXTOBJ** values.
