# General Window Creation Sequence
When you create a window of your own, such as a child window, the framework uses much the same process as that described in [Document/View Creation](../mfc/document-view-creation.md).  
  
 All the window classes provided by MFC employ [two-stage construction](../mfc/one-stage-and-two-stage-construction-of-objects.md). That is, during an invocation of the C++ **new** operator, the constructor allocates and initializes a C++ object but does not create a corresponding Windows window. That is done afterward by calling the [Create](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__create) member function of the window object.  
  
 The **Create** member function makes the Windows window and stores its `HWND` in the C++ object's public data member [m_hWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__m_hwnd). **Create** gives complete flexibility over the creation parameters. Before calling **Create**, you may want to register a window class with the global function [AfxRegisterWndClass](../mfc/reference/application-information-and-management.md#afxregisterwndclass) in order to set the icon and class styles for the frame.  
  
 For frame windows, you can use the [LoadFrame](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md#cframewnd__loadframe) member function instead of **Create**. `LoadFrame` makes the Windows window using fewer parameters. It gets many default values from resources, including the frame's caption, icon, accelerator table, and menu.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Your icon, accelerator table, and menu resources must have a common resource ID, such as **IDR_MAINFRAME**, for them to be loaded by LoadFrame.
