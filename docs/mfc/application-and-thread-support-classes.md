# Application and Thread Support Classes
Each application has one and only one application object; this object coordinates other objects in the running program and is derived from `CWinApp`.  
  
 The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library supports multiple threads of execution within an application. All applications must have at least one thread; the thread used by your `CWinApp` object is this primary thread.  
  
 `CWinThread` encapsulates a portion of the operating system's threading capabilities. To make using multiple threads easier, MFC also provides synchronization object classes to provide a C++ interface to Win32 synchronization objects.  
  
## Application and Thread Classes  
 [CWinApp](../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md)  
 Encapsulates the code to initialize, run, and terminate the application. You will derive your application object from this class.  
  
 [CWinThread](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md)  
 The base class for all threads. Use directly, or derive a class from `CWinThread` if your thread performs user-interface functions. `CWinApp` is derived from `CWinThread`.  
  
## Synchronization Object Classes  
 [CSyncObject](../mfc/reference/csyncobject-class.md)  
 Base class of the synchronization object classes.  
  
 [CCriticalSection](../mfc/reference/ccriticalsection-class.md)  
 A synchronization class that allows only one thread within a single process to access an object.  
  
 [CSemaphore](../mfc/reference/csemaphore-class.md)  
 A synchronization class that allows between one and a specified maximum number of simultaneous accesses to an object.  
  
 [CMutex](../mfc/reference/cmutex-class.md)  
 A synchronization class that allows only one thread within any number of processes to access an object.  
  
 [CEvent](../mfc/reference/cevent-class.md)  
 A synchronization class that notifies an application when an event has occurred.  
  
 [CSingleLock](../mfc/reference/csinglelock-class.md)  
 Used in member functions of thread-safe classes to lock on one synchronization object.  
  
 [CMultiLock](../mfc/reference/cmultilock-class.md)  
 Used in member functions of thread-safe classes to lock on one or more synchronization objects from an array of synchronization objects.  
  
## Related Classes  
 [CCommandLineInfo](../mfc/reference/ccommandlineinfo-class.md)  
 Parses the command line with which your program was started.  
  
 [CWaitCursor](../mfc/reference/cwaitcursor-class.md)  
 Puts a wait cursor on the screen. Used during lengthy operations.  
  
 [CDockState](../mfc/reference/cdockstate-class.md)  
 Handles persistent storage of docking state data for control bars.  
  
 [CRecentFileList](../mfc/reference/crecentfilelist-class.md)  
 Maintains the most recently used (MRU) file list.
