# Using an Image List
Typical usage of an image list follows the pattern below:  
  
-   Construct a [CImageList](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md) object and call one of the overloads of its [Create](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md#cimagelist__create) function to create an image list and attach it to the `CImageList` object.  
  
-   If you didn't add images when you created the image list, add images to the image list by calling the [Add](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md#cimagelist__add) or [Read](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md#cimagelist__read) member function.  
  
-   Associate the image list with a control by calling the appropriate member function of that control, or draw images from the image list yourself using the image list's [Draw](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md#cimagelist__draw) member function.  
  
-   Perhaps allow the user to drag an image, using the image list's built-in support for dragging.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the image list was created with the **new** operator, you must destroy the `CImageList` object when you are done with it.
