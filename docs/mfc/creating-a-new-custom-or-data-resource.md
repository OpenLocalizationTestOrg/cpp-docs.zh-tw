# Creating a New Custom or Data Resource
You can create a new custom or data resource by placing the resource in a separate file using normal resource script (.rc) file syntax, and then including that file by right-clicking your project in Solution Explorer and clicking **Resource Includes** on the shortcut menu.  
  
### To create a new custom or data resource  
  
1. [Create a .rc file](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md) that contains the custom or data resource.  
  
     You can type custom data in a .rc file as null-terminated quoted strings, or as integers in decimal, hexadecimal, or octal format.  
  
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click your project's .rc file, then click **Resource Includes** on the shortcut menu.  
  
3.  In the **Compile-Time Directives** box, type a **#include** statement that gives the name of the file containing your custom resource. For example:  
  
 ```  
    #include mydata.rc  
 ```  
  
     Make sure the syntax and spelling of what you type are correct. The contents of the **Compile-Time Directives** box are inserted into the resource script file exactly as you typed them.  
  
4.  Click **OK** to record your changes.  
  
 Another way to create a custom resource is to import an external file as the custom resource. For more information, see [Importing and Exporting Resources](../windows/how-to-import-and-export-resources.md).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
