# Do I Have to Derive New Classes from CObject?
No, you don't.  
  
 Derive a class from [CObject](../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md) when you need the facilities it provides, such as serialization or dynamic creatability. Many data classes need to be serialized to files, so it's often a good idea to derive them from `CObject`. For an example of a class derived from `CObject`, see the [Scribble sample](../visual-cpp-samples.md).
