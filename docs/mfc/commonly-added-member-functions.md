# Commonly Added Member Functions
If your dialog box contains pushbuttons other than OK or Cancel, you need to write message-handler member functions in your dialog class to respond to the control-notification messages they generate. For an example, see the [Scribble](../visual-cpp-samples.md) sample program. You can also handle control-notification messages from other controls in your dialog box.
