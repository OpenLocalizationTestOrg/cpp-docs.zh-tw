# Output (Device Context) Classes
These classes encapsulate the different types of device contexts available in Windows.  
  
 Most of the following classes encapsulate a handle to a Windows device context. A device context is a Windows object that contains information about the drawing attributes of a device such as a display or a printer. All drawing calls are made through a device-context object. Additional classes derived from `CDC` encapsulate specialized device-context functionality, including support for Windows metafiles.  
  
 [CDC](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md)  
 The base class for device contexts. Used directly for accessing the whole display and for accessing nondisplay contexts such as printers.  
  
 [CPaintDC](../mfc/reference/cpaintdc-class.md)  
 A display context used in `OnPaint` member functions of windows. Automatically calls `BeginPaint` on construction and `EndPaint` on destruction.  
  
 [CClientDC](../mfc/reference/cclientdc-class.md)  
 A display context for client areas of windows. Used, for example, to draw in an immediate response to mouse events.  
  
 [CWindowDC](../mfc/reference/cwindowdc-class.md)  
 A display context for entire windows, including both the client and nonclient areas.  
  
 [CMetaFileDC](../mfc/reference/cmetafiledc-class.md)  
 A device context for Windows metafiles. A Windows metafile contains a sequence of graphics device interface (GDI) commands that can be replayed to create an image. Calls made to the member functions of a `CMetaFileDC` are recorded in a metafile.  
  
## Related Classes  
 [CPoint](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md)  
 Holds coordinate (x, y) pairs.  
  
 [CSize](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md)  
 Holds distance, relative positions, or paired values.  
  
 [CRect](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md)  
 Holds coordinates of rectangular areas.  
  
 [CRgn](../mfc/reference/crgn-class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI region for manipulating an elliptical, polygonal, or irregular area within a window. Used in conjunction with the clipping member functions in class `CDC`.  
  
 [CRectTracker](../mfc/reference/crecttracker-class.md)  
 Displays and handles the user interface for resizing and moving rectangular objects.  
  
 [CColorDialog](../mfc/reference/ccolordialog-class.md)  
 Provides a standard dialog box for selecting a color.  
  
 [CFontDialog](../mfc/reference/cfontdialog-class.md)  
 Provides a standard dialog box for selecting a font.  
  
 [CPrintDialog](../mfc/reference/cprintdialog-class.md)  
 Provides a standard dialog box for printing a file.
