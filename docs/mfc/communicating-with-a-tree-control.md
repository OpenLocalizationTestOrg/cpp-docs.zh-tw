# Communicating with a Tree Control
You use different methods for calling member functions in a [CTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctreectrl-class.md) object depending on how the object was created:  
  
-   If the tree control is in a dialog box, use a member variable of type `CTreeCtrl` that you create in the dialog box class.  
  
-   If the tree control is a child window, use the `CTreeCtrl` object (or pointer) you used to construct the object.  
  
-   If you're using a `CTreeView` object, use the function [CTreeView::GetTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctreeview-class.md#ctreeview__gettreectrl) to get a reference to the tree control. You can initialize another reference with this value or assign the address of the reference to a `CTreeCtrl` pointer.
