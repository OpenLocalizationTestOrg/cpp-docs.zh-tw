### To select multiple controls  
  
1.  In the [Toolbox Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox), select the **Pointer** tool.  
  
2.  Drag the pointer to draw a selection box around the controls you want to select in your dialog box.  
  
     When you release the mouse button, all controls inside and intersecting the selection box are selected.  
  
     \- or -  
  
-   Hold down the SHIFT key and click the controls you'd like to include in the selection.  
  
     \- or -  
  
-   Hold down the Ctrl key and click the controls you'd like to include in the selection.  
  
#### To remove a control from a group of selected controls or to add a control to a group of selected controls  
  
1.  With a group of controls selected, hold down the SHIFT key and click the control you want to remove from or add to the existing selection.
