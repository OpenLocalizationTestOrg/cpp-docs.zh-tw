# Exceptions: OLE Exceptions
The techniques and facilities for handling exceptions in OLE are the same as those for handling other exceptions. For further information on exception handling, see the article [C++ Exception Handling](../cpp/cpp-exception-handling.md).  
  
 All exception objects are derived from the abstract base class `CException`. MFC provides two classes for handling OLE exceptions:  
  
-   [COleException](../mfc/reference/coleexception-class.md) For handling general OLE exceptions.  
  
-   [COleDispatchException](../mfc/reference/coledispatchexception-class.md) For generating and handling OLE dispatch (automation) exceptions.  
  
 The difference between these two classes is the amount of information they provide and where they are used. `COleException` has a public data member that contains the OLE status code for the exception. `COleDispatchException` supplies more information, including the following:  
  
-   An application-specific error code  
  
-   An error description, such as "Disk full"  
  
-   A Help context that your application can use to provide additional information for the user  
  
-   The name of your application's Help file  
  
-   The name of the application that generated the exception  
  
 `COleDispatchException` provides more information so that it can be used with products like Microsoft Visual Basic. The verbal error description can be used in a message box or other notification; the Help information can be used to help the user respond to the conditions that caused the exception.  
  
 Two global functions correspond to the two OLE exception classes: [AfxThrowOleException](../mfc/reference/exception-processing.md#afxthrowoleexception) and [AfxThrowOleDispatchException](../mfc/reference/exception-processing.md#afxthrowoledispatchexception). Use them to throw general OLE exceptions and OLE dispatch exceptions, respectively.
