# Inserting a Space Between Buttons on a Toolbar
In general, to insert a space between buttons, simply drag them away from one another on the toolbar. To remove space, drag them towards each other.  
  
### To insert a space before a button that is not followed by a space  
  
1.  Drag the button to the right or down until it overlaps the next button about halfway.  
  
### To insert a space before a button which is followed by a space and to retain that trailing space  
  
1.  Drag the button until the right or bottom edge is just touching the next button or just overlaps it.  
  
### To insert a space before a button that is followed by a space and close up that following space  
  
1.  Drag the button to the right or down until it overlaps the next button about halfway.
