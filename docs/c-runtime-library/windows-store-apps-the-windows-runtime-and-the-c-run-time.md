# Windows Store Apps, the Windows Runtime, and the C Run-Time
[!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps are programs that run in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] that executes on [!INCLUDE[win8](../build/reference/includes/win8_md.md)].  The [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] is a trustworthy environment that controls the functions, variables, and resources that are available to a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app. However, by design, [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] restrictions prevent the use of most C Run-Time Library (CRT) features in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] does not support the following CRT features:  
  
-   Most CRT functions that are related to unsupported functionality.  
  
     For example, a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app cannot create a process by using the `exec` and `spawn` families of routines.  
  
     When a CRT function is not supported in a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app, that fact is noted in its reference article.  
  
-   Most multibyte character and string functions.  
  
     However, both Unicode and ANSI text are supported.  
  
-   Console apps and command-line arguments.  
  
     However, traditional desktop apps still support the console and command-line arguments.  
  
-   Environment variables.  
  
-   The concept of a current working directory.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps and DLLs that are statically linked to the CRT and built by using the [/MT](../build/reference/md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library.md) or `/MTd` compiler options.  
  
     That is, an app that uses a multithread, static version of the CRT.  
  
-   An app that's built by using the [/MDd](../build/reference/md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library.md) compiler option.  
  
     That is, a debug, multithread, and DLL-specific version of the CRT. Such an app is not supported on the [!INCLUDE[win8_appstore_long](../build/reference/includes/win8_appstore_long_md.md)].  
  
 For a complete list of CRT functions that are not available in a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app and suggestions for alternative functions, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).
