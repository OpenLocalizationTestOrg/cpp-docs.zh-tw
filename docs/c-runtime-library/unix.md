# UNIX
If you plan to port your programs to UNIX, follow these guidelines:  
  
-   Do not remove header files from the SYS subdirectory. You can place the SYS header files elsewhere only if you do not plan to transport your programs to UNIX.  
  
-   Use the UNIX-compatible path delimiter in routines that take strings representing paths and filenames as arguments. UNIX supports only the forward slash (/) for this purpose, whereas Win32 operating systems support both the backslash (\\) and the forward slash (/). Thus this documentation uses UNIX-compatible forward slashes as path delimiters in `#include` statements, for example. (However, the Windows operating system command shell, CMD.EXE, does not support the forward slash in commands entered at the command prompt.)  
  
-   Use paths and filenames that work correctly in UNIX, which is case sensitive. The file allocation table (FAT) file system in Win32 operating systems is not case sensitive; the NTFS file system preserves case for directory listings but ignores case in file searches and other system operations.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In this version of Visual C++, UNIX compatibility information has been removed from the function descriptions.
