# SBCS and MBCS Data Types
Any Microsoft `MBCS` run-time library routine that handles only one multibyte character or one byte of a multibyte character expects an `unsigned``int` argument (where 0x00 <= character value <= 0xFFFF and 0x00 <= byte value <= 0xFF ). An `MBCS` routine that handles multibyte bytes or characters in a string context expects a multibyte-character string to be represented as an `unsigned``char` pointer.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Each byte of a multibyte character can be represented in an 8-bit `char`. However, an `SBCS` or `MBCS` single-byte character of type `char` with a value greater than 0x7F is negative. When such a character is converted directly to an `int` or a `long`, the result is sign-extended by the compiler and can therefore yield unexpected results.  
  
 Therefore it is best to represent a byte of a multibyte character as an 8-bit `unsigned char`. Or, to avoid a negative result, simply convert a single-byte character of type `char` to an `unsigned char` before converting it to an `int` or a `long`.  
  
 Because some `SBCS` string-handling functions take (signed) `char*` parameters, a type mismatch compiler warning will result when `_MBCS` is defined. There are three ways to avoid this warning, listed in order of efficiency:  
  
1.  Use the "type-safe" inline functions in TCHAR.H. This is the default behavior.  
  
2.  Use the "direct" macros in TCHAR.H by defining `_MB_MAP_DIRECT` on the command line. If you do this, you must manually match types. This is the fastest method but is not type-safe.  
  
3.  Use the "type-safe" statically linked library functions in TCHAR.H. To do so, define the constant `_NO_INLINING` on the command line. This is the slowest method, but the most type-safe.
