# operator delete (CRT)

Beginning in Visual Studio 2013, the Universal C Runtime (UCRT) no longer supports the C++-specific operator new and operator delete functions. These are now part of the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [new and delete operators](../cpp/new-and-delete-operators.md) and [delete operator](../cpp/delete-operator-cpp.md) in the C++ Language Reference.
