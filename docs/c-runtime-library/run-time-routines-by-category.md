# Run-Time Routines by Category
This section lists and describes Microsoft run-time library routines by category. For reference convenience, some routines are listed in more than one category. Multibyte-character routines and wide-character routines are grouped with single-byte â€“ character counterparts, where they exist.  
  
 This section also provides .NET Framework equivalent methods or classes where available.  
  
 The main categories of Microsoft run-time library routines are:  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[Argument Access](../c-runtime-library/argument-access.md)|[Buffer Manipulation](../c-runtime-library/buffer-manipulation.md)|  
|[Byte Classification](../c-runtime-library/byte-classification.md)|[Character Classification](../c-runtime-library/character-classification.md)|  
|[Data Alignment](../c-runtime-library/data-alignment.md)|[Data Conversion](../c-runtime-library/data-conversion.md)|
