# mbsrtowcs
Converts a multibyte character string in the current locale to a corresponding wide character string, with the capability of restarting in the middle of a multibyte character. A more secure version of this function is available; see [mbsrtowcs_s](../../c-runtime-library/reference/mbsrtowcs-s.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_t mbsrtowcs(  
   wchar_t *wcstr,  
   const char **mbstr,  
   sizeof count,  
   mbstate_t *mbstate  
);  
template <size_t size>  
size_t mbsrtowcs(  
   wchar_t (&wcstr)[size],  
   const char **mbstr,  
   sizeof count,  
   mbstate_t *mbstate  
); // C++ only  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [out] `wcstr`  
 Address to store the resulting converted wide character string.  
  
 [in, out] `mbstr`  
 Indirect pointer to the location of the multibyte character string to convert.  
  
 [in] `count`  
 The maximum number of characters (not bytes) to convert and store in `wcstr`.  
  
 [in, out] `mbstate`  
 A pointer to an `mbstate_t` conversion state object. If this value is a null pointer, a static internal conversion state object is used. Because the internal `mbstate_t` object is not thread-safe, we recommend that you always pass your own `mbstate` parameter.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns the number of characters successfully converted, not including the terminating null character, if any. Returns (size_t)(-1) if an error occurred, and sets `errno` to EILSEQ.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `mbsrtowcs` function converts a string of multibyte characters indirectly pointed to by `mbstr`, into wide characters stored in the buffer pointed to by `wcstr`, by using the conversion state contained in `mbstate`. The conversion continues for each character until either a terminating null multibyte character is encountered, a multibyte sequence that does not correspond to a valid character in the current locale is encountered, or until `count` characters have been converted. If `mbsrtowcs` encounters the multibyte null character ('\0') either before or when `count` occurs, it converts it to a 16-bit terminating null character and stops.  
  
 Thus, the wide character string at `wcstr` is null-terminated only if `mbsrtowcs` encounters a multibyte null character during conversion. If the sequences pointed to by `mbstr` and `wcstr` overlap, the behavior of `mbsrtowcs` is undefined. `mbsrtowcs` is affected by the LC_TYPE category of the current locale.  
  
 The `mbsrtowcs` function differs from [mbstowcs, _mbstowcs_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/mbstowcs-mbstowcs-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in `mbstate` for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions.  For example, an application should use `mbsrlen` instead of `mbslen`, if a subsequent call to `mbsrtowcs` is used instead of `mbstowcs.`  
  
 If `wcstr` is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by `mbstr` is assigned a null pointer if conversion stopped because a terminating null character was reached. Otherwise, it is assigned the address just past the last multibyte character converted, if any. This allows a subsequent function call to restart conversion where this call stopped.  
  
 If the `wcstr` argument is a null pointer, the `count` argument is ignored and `mbsrtowcs` returns the required size in wide characters for the destination string. If `mbstate` is a null pointer, the function uses a non-thread-safe static internal `mbstate_t` conversion state object. If the character sequence `mbstr` does not have a corresponding multibyte character representation, a -1 is returned and the `errno` is set to `EILSEQ`.  
  
 If `mbstr` isa null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns -1.  
  
 In C++, this function has a template overload that invokes the newer, secure counterpart of this function. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).  
  
## Exceptions  
 The `mbsrtowcs` function is multithread safe as long as no function in the current thread calls `setlocale` as long as this function is executing and the `mbstate` argument is not a null pointer.  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
