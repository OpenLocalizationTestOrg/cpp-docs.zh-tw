# putc, putwc
Writes a character to a stream.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      int putc(  
   int c,  
   FILE *stream   
);  
wint_t putwc(  
   wchar_t c,  
   FILE *stream   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `c`  
 Character to be written.  
  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to **FILE** structure.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns the character written. To indicate an error or end-of-file condition, `putc` and `putchar` return `EOF`; `putwc` and `putwchar` return **WEOF**. For all four routines, use [ferror](../../c-runtime-library/reference/ferror.md) or [feof](../../c-runtime-library/reference/feof.md) to check for an error or end of file. If passed a null pointer for `stream`, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EOF` or **WEOF** and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.  
  
 See [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md) for more information on these, and other, error codes.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `putc` routine writes the single character `c` to the output `stream` at the current position. Any integer can be passed to `putc`, but only the lower 8 bits are written. The `putchar` routine is identical to **putc(** `c`**, stdout )**. For each routine, if a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set. `putc` and `putchar` are similar to `fputc` and `_fputchar`, respectively, but are implemented both as functions and as macros (see [Choosing Between Functions and Macros](../../c-runtime-library/recommendations-for-choosing-between-functions-and-macros.md)). `putwc` and `putwchar` are wide-character versions of `putc` and `putchar`, respectively. `putwc` and `putc` behave identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. `putc` doesn't currently support output into a UNICODE stream.  
  
 The versions with the **_nolock** suffix are identical except that they are not protected from interference by other threads. For more information, see **_putc_nolock, _putwc_nolock**.  
  
### Generic-Text Routine Mappings  
  
|TCHAR.H routine|_UNICODE & _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|  
|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|  
|`_puttc`|`putc`|`putc`|**putwc**|  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`putc`|\<stdio.h>|  
|`putwc`|\<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h>|  
  
 The console is not supported in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps. The standard stream handles that are associated with the console—`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`—must be redirected before C run-time functions can use them in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps. For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  
  
## Libraries  
 All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_putc.c  
/* This program uses putc to write buffer  
 * to a stream. If an error occurs, the program  
 * stops before writing the entire buffer.  
 */  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   FILE *stream;  
   char *p, buffer[] = "This is the line of output\n";  
   int  ch;  
  
   ch = 0;  
   /* Make standard out the stream and write to it. */  
   stream = stdout;  
   for( p = buffer; (ch != EOF) && (*p != '\0'); p++ )  
      ch = putc( *p, stream );  
}  
```  
  
## Output  
  
```  
This is the line of output  
```
