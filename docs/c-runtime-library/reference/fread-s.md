# fread_s
Reads data from a stream. This version of [fread](../../c-runtime-library/reference/fread.md) has security enhancements, as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_t fread_s(   
   void *buffer,  
   size_t bufferSize,  
   size_t elementSize,  
   size_t count,  
   FILE *stream   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `buffer`  
 Storage location for data.  
  
 `bufferSize`  
 Size of the destination buffer in bytes.  
  
 `elementSize`  
 Size of the item to read in bytes.  
  
 `count`  
 Maximum number of items to be read.  
  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to `FILE` structure.  
  
## Return Value  
 `fread_s` returns the number of (whole) items that were read into the buffer, which may be less than `count` if a read error or the end of the file is encountered before `count` is reached. Use the `feof` or `ferror` function to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition. If `size` or `count` is 0, `fread_s` returns 0 and the buffer contents are unchanged. If `stream` or `buffer` is a null pointer, `fread_s` invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns 0.  
  
 For more information about error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The `fread_s` function reads up to `count` items of `elementSize` bytes from the input `stream` and stores them in `buffer`.  The file pointer that is associated with `stream` (if there is one) is increased by the number of bytes actually read. If the given stream is opened in text mode, carriage returnâ€“linefeed pairs are replaced with single linefeed characters. The replacement has no effect on the file pointer or the return value. The file-pointer position is indeterminate if an error occurs. The value of a partially read item cannot be determined.  
  
 This function locks out other threads. If you require a non-locking version, use `_fread_nolock`.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Function|Required header|  
|--------------|---------------------|  
|`fread_s`|\<stdio.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```cpp  
  
// crt_fread_s.c  
// Command line: cl /EHsc /nologo /W4 crt_fread_s.c  
//  
// This program opens a file that's named FREAD.OUT and  
// writes characters to the file. It then tries to open  
// FREAD.OUT and read in characters by using fread_s. If the attempt succeeds,  
// the program displays the number of actual items read.  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
#define BUFFERSIZE 30  
#define DATASIZE 22  
#define ELEMENTCOUNT 2  
#define ELEMENTSIZE (DATASIZE/ELEMENTCOUNT)  
#define FILENAME "FREAD.OUT"  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   FILE *stream;  
   char list[30];  
   int  i, numread, numwritten;  
  
   for ( i = 0; i < DATASIZE; i++ )  
      list[i] = (char)('z' - i);  
   list[DATASIZE] = '\0'; // terminal null so we can print it  
  
   // Open file in text mode:  
   if( fopen_s( &stream, FILENAME, "w+t" ) == 0 )  
   {  
      // Write DATASIZE characters to stream   
      printf( "Contents of buffer before write/read:\n\t%s\n\n", list );  
      numwritten = fwrite( list, sizeof( char ), DATASIZE, stream );  
      printf( "Wrote %d items\n\n", numwritten );  
      fclose( stream );  
   } else {  
      printf( "Problem opening the file\n" );  
      return -1;  
   }  
  
   if( fopen_s( &stream, FILENAME, "r+t" ) == 0 )   {  
      // Attempt to read in characters in 2 blocks of 11  
      numread = fread_s( list, BUFFERSIZE, ELEMENTSIZE, ELEMENTCOUNT, stream );  
      printf( "Number of %d-byte elements read = %d\n\n", ELEMENTSIZE, numread );  
      printf( "Contents of buffer after write/read:\n\t%s\n", list );  
      fclose( stream );  
   } else {  
      printf( "File could not be opened\n" );  
      return -1;  
   }  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
Contents of buffer before write/read:   
        zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfe  
  
Wrote 22 items  
  
Number of 11-byte elements read = 2  
  
Contents of buffer after write/read:   
        zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfe  
  
```
