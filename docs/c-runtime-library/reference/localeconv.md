# localeconv
Gets detailed information on locale settings.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
struct lconv *localeconv( void );  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 `localeconv` returns a pointer to a filled-in object of type [struct lconv](../../c-runtime-library/standard-types.md). The values contained in the object can be overwritten by subsequent calls to `localeconv` and do not directly modify the object. Calls to [setlocale](../../c-runtime-library/reference/setlocale-wsetlocale.md) with `category` values of `LC_ALL`, `LC_MONETARY`, or `LC_NUMERIC` overwrite the contents of the structure.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `localeconv` function gets detailed information about numeric formatting for the current locale. This information is stored in a structure of type **lconv**. The **lconv** structure, defined in LOCALE.H, contains the following members:  
  
 `char *decimal_point, wchar_t *_W_decimal_point`  
 Decimal-point character for nonmonetary quantities.  
  
 `char *thousands_sep, wchar_t *_W_thousands_sep`  
 Character that separates groups of digits to left of decimal point for nonmonetary quantities.  
  
 `char *grouping`  
 Size of each group of digits in nonmonetary quantities.  
  
 `char *int_curr_symbol, wchar_t *_W_int_curr_symbol`  
 International currency symbol for current locale. First three characters specify alphabetic international currency symbol as defined in the *ISO 4217 Codes for the Representation of Currency and Funds* standard. Fourth character (immediately preceding null character) separates international currency symbol from monetary quantity.  
  
 `char *currency_symbol, wchar_t *_W_currency_symbol`  
 Local currency symbol for current locale.  
  
 `char *mon_decimal_point, wchar_t *_W_mon_decimal_point`  
 Decimal-point character for monetary quantities.  
  
 `char *mon_thousands_sep, wchar_t *_W_mon_thousands_sep`  
 Separator for groups of digits to left of decimal place in monetary quantities.  
  
 `char *mon_grouping`  
 Size of each group of digits in monetary quantities.  
  
 `char *positive_sign, wchar_t *_W_positive_sign`  
 String denoting sign for nonnegative monetary quantities.  
  
 `char *negative_sign, wchar_t *_W_negative_sign`  
 String denoting sign for negative monetary quantities.  
  
 `char int_frac_digits`  
 Number of digits to right of decimal point in internationally formatted monetary quantities.  
  
 `char frac_digits`  
 Number of digits to right of decimal point in formatted monetary quantities.  
  
 `char p_cs_precedes`  
 Set to 1 if currency symbol precedes value for nonnegative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if symbol follows value.  
  
 `char p_sep_by_space`  
 Set to 1 if currency symbol is separated by space from value for nonnegative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if there is no space separation.  
  
 `char n_cs_precedes`  
 Set to 1 if currency symbol precedes value for negative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if symbol succeeds value.  
  
 `char n_sep_by_space`  
 Set to 1 if currency symbol is separated by space from value for negative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if there is no space separation.  
  
 `char p_sign_posn`  
 Position of positive sign in nonnegative formatted monetary quantities.  
  
 `char n_sign_posn`  
 Position of positive sign in negative formatted monetary quantities.  
  
 Members of the structure that have `char` `*` and `wchar_t *` versions are pointers to strings. Any of these that equals `""` (or `L""` for `wchar_t *`) is either of zero length or not supported in the current locale. Note that `decimal_point` and `_W_decimal_point` are always supported and of nonzero length.  
  
 The `char` members of the structure are small nonnegative numbers, not characters. Any of these that equals **CHAR_MAX** is not supported in the current locale.  
  
 The elements of **grouping** and **mon_grouping** are interpreted according to the following rules.  
  
 **CHAR_MAX**  
 Do not perform any further grouping.  
  
 0  
 Use previous element for each of remaining digits.  
  
 *n*  
 Number of digits that make up current group. Next element is examined to determine size of next group of digits before current group.  
  
 The values for **int_curr_symbol** are interpreted according to the following rules:  
  
-   The first three characters specify the alphabetic international currency symbol as defined in the *ISO 4217 Codes for the Representation of Currency and Funds* standard.  
  
-   The fourth character (immediately preceding the null character) separates the international currency symbol from the monetary quantity.  
  
 The values for **p_cs_precedes** and **n_cs_precedes** are interpreted according to the following rules (the **n_cs_precedes** rule is in parentheses):  
  
 0  
 Currency symbol follows value for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  
  
 1  
 Currency symbol precedes value for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  
  
 The values for **p_sep_by_space** and **n_sep_by_space** are interpreted according to the following rules (the **n_sep_by_space** rule is in parentheses):  
  
 0  
 Currency symbol is separated from value by space for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  
  
 1  
 There is no space separation between currency symbol and value for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  
  
 The values for **p_sign_posn** and **n_sign_posn** are interpreted according to the following rules:  
  
 0  
 Parentheses surround quantity and currency symbol.  
  
 1  
 Sign string precedes quantity and currency symbol.  
  
 2  
 Sign string follows quantity and currency symbol.  
  
 3  
 Sign string immediately precedes currency symbol.  
  
 4  
 Sign string immediately follows currency symbol.
