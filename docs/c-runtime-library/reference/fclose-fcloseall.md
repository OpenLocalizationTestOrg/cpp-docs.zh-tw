# fclose, _fcloseall
Closes a stream (`fclose`) or closes all open streams (`_fcloseall`).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int fclose(   
   FILE *stream   
);  
int _fcloseall( void );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to `FILE` structure.  
  
## Return Value  
 `fclose` returns 0 if the stream is successfully closed. `_fcloseall` returns the total number of streams closed. Both functions return `EOF` to indicate an error.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `fclose` function closes `stream`. If `stream` is `NULL`, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, `fclose` sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns `EOF`. It is recommended that the `stream` pointer always be checked prior to calling this function.  
  
 See [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md) for more information on these, and other, error codes.  
  
 The `_fcloseall` function closes all open streams except `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` (and, in MS-DOS, `_stdaux` and `_stdprn`). It also closes and deletes any temporary files created by `tmpfile`. In both functions, all buffers associated with the stream are flushed prior to closing. System-allocated buffers are released when the stream is closed. Buffers assigned by the user with `setbuf` and `setvbuf` are not automatically released.  
  
 **Note:** When these functions are used to close a stream, the underlying file descriptor and OS file handle (or socket) are closed, as well as the stream. Thus, if the file was originally opened as a file handle or file descriptor and is closed with `fclose`, do not also call `_close` to close the file descriptor; do not call the Win32 function `CloseHandle` to close the file handle.  
  
 `fclose` and `_fcloseall` include code to protect against interference from other threads. For non-locking version of a `fclose`, see `_fclose_nolock`.
