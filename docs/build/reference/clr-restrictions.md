# /clr Restrictions
Note the following restrictions on the use of **/clr**:  
  
-   In a structured exception handler, there are restrictions on using `_alloca` when compiling with **/clr**. For more information, see [_alloca](../../c-runtime-library/reference/alloca.md).  
  
-   The use of run-time error checks is not valid with **/clr**. For more information, see [Run-Time Error Checks](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/dc7b2f1e-5ff6-42e0-89b3-dc9dead83ee1).  
  
-   When **/clr** is used to compile a program that only uses standard C++ syntax, the following guidelines apply to the use of inline assembly:  
  
    -   Inline assembly code that assumes knowledge of the native stack layout, calling conventions outside of the current function, or other low-level information about the computer may fail if that knowledge is applied to the stack frame for a managed function. Functions containing inline assembly code are generated as unmanaged functions, as if they were placed in a separate module that was compiled without **/clr**.  
  
    -   Inline assembly code in functions that pass copy-constructed function parameters is not supported.  
  
-   The [vprintf Functions](../../c-runtime-library/vprintf-functions.md) cannot be called from a program compiled with **/clr**.  
  
-   The [naked](../../cpp/naked-cpp.md) [__declspec](../../cpp/declspec.md) modifier is ignored under /clr.  
  
-   The translator function set by [_set_se_translator](../../c-runtime-library/reference/set-se-translator.md) will affect only catches in unmanaged code. See [Exception Handling](../../windows/exception-handling-cpp-component-extensions.md) for more information.  
  
-   The comparison of function pointers is not permitted under **/clr**.  
  
-   The use of functions that are not fully prototyped is not permitted under **/clr**.  
  
-   The following compiler options are not supported with **/clr**:  
  
    -   **/EHsc** and **/EHs** (**/clr** implies **/EHa** (see [/EH (Exception Handling Model)](../../build/reference/eh-exception-handling-model.md))  
  
    -   **/fp:strict** and **/fp:except** (see [/fp (Specify Floating-Point Behavior)](../../build/reference/fp-specify-floating-point-behavior.md))  
  
    -   [/Zd](../../build/reference/z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md)  
  
    -   [/Gm](../../build/reference/gm-enable-minimal-rebuild.md)  
  
    -   [/MT](../../build/reference/md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library.md)  
  
    -   [/RTC](../../build/reference/rtc-run-time-error-checks.md)  
  
    -   **/ZI**  
  
-   The combination of the `_STATIC_CPPLIB` preprocessor definition (`/D_STATIC_CPPLIB`) and the **/clr** or **/clr:pure** compiler option is not supported. This is so because the definition would cause your application to link with the static multithreaded Standard C++ Library, which is not supported. For more information, see the [/MD, /MT, /LD (Use Run-Time Library)](../../build/reference/md-mt-ld-use-run-time-library.md) topic.  
  
-   [/J](../../build/reference/j-default-char-type-is-unsigned.md) is not supported with **/clr:safe** or **/clr:pure**.  
  
-   The ATL and MFC libraries are not supported by pure mode compilation (**/clr:pure**). You can use **/clr:pure** with the Standard C++ Library and the CRT if you also compile with **/MD** or **/MDd**.  
  
-   When using **/Zi** with **/clr**, there are performance implications. For more information, see [/Zi](../../build/reference/z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md).  
  
-   Passing a wide character to a .NET Framework output routine without also specifying [/Zc:wchar_t](../../build/reference/zc-wchar-t-wchar-t-is-native-type.md) or without casting the character to `__wchar_t` will cause the output to appear as an `unsigned short int`. For example:  
  
    ```  
    Console::WriteLine(L' ')              // Will output 32.  
    Console::WriteLine((__wchar_t)L' ')   // Will output a space.  
    ```  
  
-   [/GS](../../build/reference/gs-buffer-security-check.md) is ignored when compiling with **/clr**, unless a function is under `#pragma` [unmanaged](../../preprocessor/managed-unmanaged.md) or if the function must be compiled to native, in which case the compiler will generate warning C4793, which is off by default.  
  
-   See [/ENTRY](../../build/reference/entry-entry-point-symbol.md) for function signature requirements of a managed application.  
  
-   Applications compiled with **/openmp** and **/clr** can only be run in a single appdomain process.  See [/openmp (Enable OpenMP 2.0 Support)](../../build/reference/openmp-enable-openmp-2-0-support.md) for more information.  
  
-   Functions that take a variable number of arguments (varargs) will be generated as native functions. Any managed data types in the variable argument position will be marshaled to native types. Note that <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName> types are actually wide-character strings, but they are marshaled to single-byte character strings. So if a printf specifier is %S (wchar_t*), it will marshal to a %s string instead.  
  
-   When using the va_arg macro, you may get unexpected results when compiling with **/clr:pure**.  For more information, see [va_arg, va_copy, va_end, va_start](../../c-runtime-library/reference/va-arg-va-copy-va-end-va-start.md).  
  
-   If your application passes an argument of type [va_list](../../c-runtime-library/reference/va-arg-va-copy-va-end-va-start.md) to a function declared to take a variable number of arguments, and your application is compiled with **/clr:pure**, the CLR throws <xref:System.NotSupportedException>. If **/clr**  is used instead, the affected functions are compiled to native code and execute properly. If **/clr:safe** is used, an error diagnostic is emitted.  
  
-   You should not call, from managed code, any functions that walk the stack to get parameter information (function arguments); the P/Invoke layer causes that information to be further down the stack.  For example, do not compile proxy/stub with **/clr**.  
  
-   Functions will be compiled to managed code whenever possible, but not all C++ constructs can be translated to managed code.  This determination is made on a function-by-function basis. If any part of a function cannot be converted to managed code, the entire function will be converted to native code instead. The following cases prevent the compiler from generating managed code.  
  
    -   Compiler-generated thunks or helper functions. Native thunks are generated for any function call through a function pointer, including virtual function calls.  
  
    -   Functions that call `setjmp` or `longjmp`.  
  
    -   Functions that use certain intrinsic routines to directly manipulate machine resources. For example, the use of `__enable` and `__disable`, `_ReturnAddress` and `_AddressOfReturnAddress`, or multimedia intrinsics will all result in native code.  
  
    -   Functions that follow the `#pragma unmanaged` directive. (Note that the inverse, `#pragma managed`, is also supported.)  
  
    -   A function that contains references to aligned types, that is, types declared using `__declspec(align(...))`.  
  
-   You cannot use the [Compiler COM Support](../../cpp/compiler-com-support.md) classes with **/clr:pure** or **/clr:safe**.
