# Dumping Delay-Loaded Imports
Delay-loaded imports can be dumped using [dumpbin /imports](../../build/reference/imports-dumpbin.md) and show up with slightly different information than standard imports. They are segregated into their own section of the /imports dumping and are explicitly labeled as delay-loaded imports. If there is unload information present in the image, that is noted. If there is bind information present, the time/date stamp of the target DLL is noted along with the bound addresses of the imports.
