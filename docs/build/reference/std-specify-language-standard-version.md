# /std (Specify Language Standard Version)
Enable supported C++ language features from the specified version of the C++ language standard.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/std:[c++14|c++latest]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The **/std** option is used to control the version-specific ISO C++ programming language standard features enabled during compilation of your code. This option allows you to disable support for certain new language and library features that may break your existing code that conforms to a particular version of the language standard. By default, **/std:c++14** is specified, which disables language and standard library features found in later versions of the C++ language standard. To explicitly enable the latest supported compiler and standard library features, use **/std:c++latest**.  
  
 The default **/std:c++14** option enables the set of C++14 features implemented by the Visual C++ compiler. This option disables compiler and standard library support for features that are changed or new in more recent versions of the language standard, with the exception of some C++17 features already implemented in previous releases of the Visual C++ compiler. To avoid breaking changes for users who have already taken dependencies on the features available as of Visual Studio 2015 Update 2, these features remain enabled when the **/std:c++14** option is specified:  
  
-   [Rules for auto with braced-init-lists](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3922.html)  
  
-   [typename in template template-parameters](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4051.html)  
  
-   [Removing trigraphs](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4086.html)  
  
-   [Attributes for namespaces and enumerators](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4266.html)  
  
-   [u8 character literals](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4267.html)  
  
 The **/std:c++latest** option enables the set of C++ language and library features implemented by Visual C++ to track the most recent Working Draft and defect updates of the C++ Standard. Use this switch to get the latest language features supported by the compiler. For a list of supported language and library features, see [What's New for Visual C++](../../top/what-s-new-for-visual-cpp-in-visual-studio.md). The **/std:c++latest** option does not enable features guarded by the **/experimental** switch.  
  
 The **/std:c++14** and **/std:c++latest** options are available beginning in Visual C++ 2013 Update 3.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Depending on the Visual C++ compiler version or update level, certain C++14 features may not be fully implemented or fully conformant when you specify the **/std:c++14** option. For example, the Visual C++ 2015 Update 3 compiler does not fully support C++14-conformant `constexpr`, expression SFINAE, or 2-phase name lookup.  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Select **Configuration Properties**, **C/C++**, **Command Line**.  
  
3.  In **Additional Options**, enter **/std:c++latest** to enable the latest language feature support, or **/std:c++14** to disable it and use only C++14 language features.
