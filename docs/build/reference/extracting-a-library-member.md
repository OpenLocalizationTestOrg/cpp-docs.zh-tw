# Extracting a Library Member
You can use LIB to create an object (.obj) file that contains a copy of a member of an existing library. To extract a copy of a member, use the following syntax:  
  
```  
LIB library /EXTRACT:member /OUT:objectfile  
```  
  
 This command creates an .obj file called *objectfile* that contains a copy of a `member` of a *library*. The `member` name is case sensitive. You can extract only one member in a single command. The /OUT option is required; there is no default output name. If a file called *objectfile* already exists in the specified directory (or the current directory, if no directory is specified with *objectfile*), the extracted *objectfile* replaces the existing file.
