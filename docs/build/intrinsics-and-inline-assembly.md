# Intrinsics and Inline Assembly
One of the constraints for the [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)] compiler is to have no inline assembler support. This means that functions that cannot be written in C or C++ will either have to be written as subroutines or as intrinsic functions supported by the compiler. Certain functions are performance sensitive while others are not. Performance-sensitive functions should be implemented as intrinsic functions.  
  
 The intrinsics supported by the compiler are described in [Compiler Intrinsics](../intrinsics/compiler-intrinsics.md).
