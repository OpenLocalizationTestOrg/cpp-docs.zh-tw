# Are there any MFC classes or functions that cannot be used in an MFC DLL?
Extension DLLs use the `CWinApp`-derived class of the client application. They must not have their own `CWinApp`-derived class.  
  
 Regular DLLs must have a `CWinApp`-derived class and a single object of that application class, as does an MFC application. Unlike the `CWinApp` object of an application, the `CWinApp` object of the DLL does not have a main message pump.  
  
 Note that because the `CWinApp::Run` mechanism does not apply to a DLL, the application owns the main message pump. If the DLL opens modeless dialog boxes or has a main frame window of its own, the application's main message pump must call a routine exported by the DLL, which in turn calls the `CWinApp::PreTranslateMessage` member function of the DLL's application object.
