# How to: Integrate Custom Tools into the Project Properties
You can add custom tool options to the Visual Studio **Property Pages** window by creating an underlying XML schema file.  
  
 The **Configuration Properties** section of the **Property Pages** window displays setting groups that are known as *rules*. Every rule contains the settings for a tool or a group of features. For example, the **Linker** rule contains the settings for the linker tool. The settings in a rule can be subdivided into *categories*.  
  
 This document explains how to create a file in a set directory that contains properties for your custom tool so that the properties are loaded when Visual Studio starts. For information about how to modify the file, see [Platform Extensibilty Part 2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=191489) on the Visual Studio Project Team blog.  
  
### To add or change project properties  
  
1.  In the XML editor, create an XML file.  
  
2.  Save the file in the %ProgramFiles%\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\ folder. Every rule in the **Property Pages** window is represented by an XML file in this folder. Make sure that the file is uniquely named in the folder.  
  
3.  Copy the content of %ProgramFiles%\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\cl.xml, close it without saving changes, and then paste the content in your new XML file. You can use any XML schema file â€“ this is just one that can be used so you start with a template.  
  
4.  In the new XML file, modify the content according to your requirements. Make sure to change the **Rule Name** and **Rule.DisplayName** at the top of the file.  
  
5.  Save the changes and close the file.  
  
6.  The XML files in %ProgramFiles%\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\ are loaded when Visual Studio starts. Therefore, to test the new file, restart Visual Studio.  
  
7.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click a project and then click **Properties**. In the **Property Pages** window, in the left pane, verify that there is a new node with the name of your Rule.
