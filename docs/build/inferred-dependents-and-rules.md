# Inferred Dependents and Rules
NMAKE assumes an inferred dependent for a target if an applicable inference rule exists. A rule applies if:  
  
-   *toext* matches the target's extension.  
  
-   *fromext* matches the extension of a file that has the target's base name and that exists in the current or specified directory.  
  
-   *fromext* is in [.SUFFIXES](../build/dot-directives.md); no other *fromext* in a matching rule has a higher **.SUFFIXES** priority.  
  
-   No explicit dependent has a higher **.SUFFIXES** priority.  
  
 Inferred dependents can cause unexpected side effects. If the target's description block contains commands, NMAKE executes those commands instead of the commands in the rule.
