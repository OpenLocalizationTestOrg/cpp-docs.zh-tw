# Conflicts with the x86 Compiler
Data types that are larger than 4 bytes are not automatically aligned on the stack when you use the x86 compiler to compile an application. Because the architecture for the x86 compiler is a 4 byte aligned stack, anything larger than 4 bytes, for example, a 64-bit integer, cannot be automatically aligned to an 8-byte address.  
  
 Working with unaligned data has two implications.  
  
-   It may take longer to access unaligned locations than it takes to access aligned locations.  
  
-   Unaligned locations cannot be used in interlocked operations.  
  
 If you require more strict alignment, use `__declspec(align(N)) on your variable declarations`. This causes the compiler to dynamically align the stack to meet your specifications. However, dynamically adjusting the stack at run time may cause slower execution of your application.
