# Viewing a Menu as a Pop-up Menu
Normally, when you are working in the Menu editor, a menu resource is displayed as a menu bar. However, you might have menu resources that are added to the application's menu bar while the program is running.  
  
### To view a menu resource as a pop-up menu  
  
1.  Right-click the menu and choose **View as Popup** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     This is only a viewing preference and will not modify your menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  To change back to the menu-bar view, click **View as Popup** again (which removes the check mark and returns your menu-bar view).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
 Win32
