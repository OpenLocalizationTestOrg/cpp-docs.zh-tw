# Defining Member Variables for Dialog Controls
To define a member variable for any dialog box control except buttons, you can use the following method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This article applies only to dialog controls within an MFC project. ATL projects should use the **New Windows Messages and Event Handlers** dialog box.  
  
### To define a member variable for a (non-button) dialog box control  
  
1.  In the [Dialog editor](../mfc/dialog-editor.md), select a control.  
  
2.  While pressing the **CTRL** key, double-click the dialog box control.  
  
     The [Add Member Variable wizard](../ide/add-member-variable-wizard.md) appears.  
  
3.  Type the appropriate information in the **Add Member Variable** wizard. For more information, see [Dialog Data Exchange](../mfc/dialog-data-exchange.md).  
  
4.  Click **OK** to return to the Dialog editor.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  To jump from any dialog box control to its existing handler, double-click the control.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  
  
 You can also use the **Member Variables** tab in **MFC Class Wizard** to add new member variables for a specified class, and view those that have already been defined.
