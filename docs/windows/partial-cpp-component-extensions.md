# partial  (C++ Component Extensions)
The `partial` keyword enables different parts of the same ref class to be authored independently and in different files.  
  
## All Runtimes  
 (This language feature applies only to the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)].)  
  
## [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)]  
 For a ref class that has two partial definitions, the `partial` keyword is applied to the first occurrence of the definition, and this is typically done by auto-generated code, so that a human coder doesn’t use the keyword very often. For all subsequent partial definitions of the class, omit the `partial` modifier from the *class-key* keyword and class identifier. When the compiler encounters a previously defined ref class and class identifier but no `partial` keyword, it internally combines all of the parts of the ref class definition into one definition.  
  
### Syntax  
  
```cpp  
  
      partial  
      class-key  
      identifier {  
   /* The first part of the partial class definition. This is typically auto-generated*/  
}  
// ...  
class-keyidentifier {  
   /* The subsequent part(s) of the class definition. The same identifier is specified, but the "partial" keyword is omitted. */  
}  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *class-key*  
 A keyword that declares a class or struct that is supported by the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)]. Either `ref class`, `value class`, `ref struct`, or `value struct`.  
  
 *identifier*  
 The name of the defined type.  
  
### Remarks  
 A partial class supports scenarios where you modify one part of a class definition in one file, and automatic code-generating software—for example, the XAML designer—modifies code in the same class in another file. By using a partial class, you can prevent the automatic code generator from overwriting your code. In a Visual Studio project, the `partial` modifier is applied automatically to the generated file.  
  
 Contents: With two exceptions, a partial class definition can contain anything that the full class definition could contain if the `partial` keyword was omitted. However, you can't specify class accessibility (for example, `public partial class X {…};`),  or a `declspec`.  
  
 Access specifiers used in a partial class definition for *identifier* do not affect the default accessibility in a subsequent partial or full class definition for *identifier*. Inline definitions of static data members are allowed.  
  
 Declaration: A partial definition of a class *identifier* only introduces the name *identifier*, but *identifier* cannot be used in a way that requires a class definition. The name *identifier* can't be used to know the size of *identifier*, or to use a base or member of *identifier* until after the compiler encounters the full definition of *identifier*.  
  
 Number and ordering: There can be zero or more partial class definitions for *identifier*. Every partial class definition of *identifier* must lexically precede the one full definition of *identifier* (if there is a full definition; otherwise, the class can't be used except as if forward-declared) but need not precede forward declarations of *identifier*. All class-keys must match.  
  
 Full definition: At the point of the full definition of the class *identifier*, the behavior is the same as if the definition of *identifier* had declared all base classes, members, etc. in the order in which they were encountered and defined in the partial classes.  
  
 Templates: A partial class cannot be a template.  
  
 Generics: A partial class can be a generic if the full definition could be generic. But every partial and full class must have exactly the same generic parameters, including formal parameter names.
