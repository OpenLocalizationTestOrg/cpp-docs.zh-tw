# How to: Change the Language or Condition of a Resource While Copying
While copying in a resource, you can change its language property or condition property, or both.  
  
-   The language of the resource identifies just that, the language for the resource. This is used by [FindResource](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms648042) to help identify the resource for which you're looking. (However, resources can have differences for each language that aren't related to text, for example, accelerators that might only work on a Japanese keyboard or a bitmap that would only be appropriate for Chinese localized builds, etc.)  
  
-   The condition of a resource is a defined symbol that identifies a condition under which this particular copy of the resource is to be used.  
  
 The language and condition of a resource are shown in parentheses after the name of the resource in the Workspace window. In this example the resource named IDD_AboutBox is using Finnish as its language and its condition is XX33.  
  
```  
IDD_AboutBox (Finnish â€“ XX33)  
```  
  
### To copy an existing resource and change its language or condition  
  
1.  In the .rc file or in the [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md) window, right-click the resource you want to copy.  
  
2.  Choose **Insert Copy** from the shortcut menu.  
  
3.  In the **Insert Resource Copy** dialog box:  
  
    -   For the **Language** list box, select the language.  
  
    -   In the **Condition** box, type the condition.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
