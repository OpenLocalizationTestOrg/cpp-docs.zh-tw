# Attributed Programming Concepts
Visual C++ includes a variety of material to help you use attributes in your programs. Attributes, a new feature in Visual C++, are designed to simplify COM programming and .NET Framework common language runtime development. When you include attributes in your source files, the compiler works with provider dynamic-link libraries (DLL) to insert code or modify the code in the generated object files. There are attributes that aid in the creation of .idl files, interfaces, type libraries, and other COM elements. In the integrated development environment (IDE), attributes are supported by the wizards and by the Properties window.  
  
 While attributes eliminate some of the detailed coding needed to write COM objects, you need a background in [COM fundamentals](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms694363) to best use them.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Purpose of Attributes](../windows/purpose-of-attributes.md)  
 Presents an overview of attributed programming.  
  
 [Basic Mechanics of Attributes](../windows/basic-mechanics-of-attributes.md)  
 Describes how attributes work in your project.  
  
 [Building an Attributed Program](../windows/building-an-attributed-program.md)  
 Provides information about using C++ compiler options in your project.  
  
 [Attribute Categories](../windows/attribute-categories.md)  
 Provides links to the categories of attributes used in Visual C++.  
  
 [Attribute Programmming FAQ](../windows/attribute-programming-faq.md)  
 Answers frequently asked questions about attributed programming.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Attributes Reference](../windows/cpp-attributes-reference.md)  
 Provides links to reference topic describing the individual attributes and their use.  
  
 [Debugging Injected Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/a1b4104d-d49e-451f-a91e-e39ceaf35875)  
 Describes debugging attributed programs.  
  
 [__super](../cpp/super.md)and [__interface](../cpp/interface.md)  
 Links to new C++ keywords related to attributed programming.  
  
 [(NOTINBUILD)Visual C++ Programming Methodologies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0822f806-fa81-4b65-bf0f-1e2921f30c95)  
 Provides links to topics describing conceptual information about the Visual C++ libraries and topics discussing various coding technologies and techniques.
