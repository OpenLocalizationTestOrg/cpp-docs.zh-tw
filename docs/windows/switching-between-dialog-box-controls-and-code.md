# Switching Between Dialog Box Controls and Code
In MFC applications, you can double-click on dialog box controls to jump to their handler code or to quickly create stub handler functions.  
  
 With a control selected, click the **ControlEvents** button or the **Messages** button in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window) to view a complete list of Windows messages and events available for the selected item. Choose from the list to create or edit handler functions.  
  
### To jump to code from the dialog editor  
  
1.  Double-click on a control within the dialog box to jump to the declaration for its most-recently implemented message handling function. (For ATL-based dialog classes, you always jump to the constructor definition.)  
  
### To view events for a control  
  
1.  With a control selected, click the **ControlEvents** button in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Clicking the **ControlEvents** button when the *dialog box* has focus exposes a list of all the controls in the dialog box, which you can then expand to edit the events for the individual controls.  
  
     When a single control has focus in the dialog box, you can right-click it and select **Add Event Handler** from the shortcut menu. This enables you to specify the class to which the handler is added. For more information, see [Adding an Event Handler](../ide/adding-an-event-handler-visual-cpp.md).  
  
### To view messages for a dialog box  
  
1.  With the dialog box selected, click the **Messages** button in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).
