# Resource Includes Dialog Box
You can use the **Resource Includes** dialog box to modify the environment's normal working arrangement of storing all resources in the project .rc file and all [symbols](../mfc/symbols-resource-identifiers.md) in Resource.h.  
  
 To open the **Resource Includes** dialog box, right-click an .rc file in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), then choose **Resource Includes** from the shortcut menu.  
  
 **Symbol header file**  
 Allows you to change the name of the header file where the symbol definitions for your resource file are stored. For more information, see [Changing the Names of Symbol Header Files](../windows/changing-the-names-of-symbol-header-files.md).  
  
 **Read-only symbol directives**  
 Enables you to include header files that contain symbols that should not be modified during an editing session. For example, you can include a symbol file that is shared among several projects. You can also include MFC .h files. For more information, see [Including Shared (Read-Only) or Calculated Symbols](../windows/including-shared-read-only-or-calculated-symbols.md).  
  
 **Compile-time directives**  
 Allows you to include resource files that are created and edited separately from the resources in your main resource file, contain compile-time directives (such as those that conditionally include resources), or contain resources in a custom format. You can also use the Compile-time directives box to include standard MFC resource files. For more information, see [Including Resources at Compile Time](../windows/how-to-include-resources-at-compile-time.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Entries in these text boxes appear in the .rc file marked by `TEXTINCLUDE 1`, `TEXTINCLUDE 2`, and `TEXTINCLUDE 3` respectively. For more information, see [TN035: Using Multiple Resource Files and Header Files with Visual C++](../mfc/tn035-using-multiple-resource-files-and-header-files-with-visual-cpp.md).  
  
 Once you have made changes to your resource file using the **Resource Includes** dialog box, you need to close the .rc file and then reopen it for the changes to take effect. For more information, see [Including Resources at Compile Time](../windows/how-to-include-resources-at-compile-time.md).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
