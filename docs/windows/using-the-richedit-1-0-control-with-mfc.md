# Using the RichEdit 1.0 Control with MFC
To use a RichEdit control, you must first call [AfxInitRichEdit2](../mfc/reference/application-information-and-management.md#afxinitrichedit2) to load the RichEdit 2.0 Control (RICHED20.DLL), or call [AfxInitRichEdit](../mfc/reference/application-information-and-management.md#afxinitrichedit) to load the older RichEdit 1.0 Control (RICHED32.DLL).  
  
 You may use the current [CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md) class with the older RichEdit 1.0 control, but **CRichEditCtrl** is only designed to support the RichEdit 2.0 control. Because RichEdit 1.0 and RichEdit 2.0 are very similar, most methods will work; however, note there are some differences between the 1.0 and 2.0 controls, so some methods might work incorrectly or not work at all.
